# Documentation Consolidation Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Clarified Documentation Structure

We now have clear separation between:
- **`/docs`** - Internal developer documentation
- **`/documentation`** - Public user documentation for docs.hokus.ai

### 2. Updated README Files

- Added clear headers to both `/docs/README.md` and `/documentation/README.md` explaining their purpose
- Each README now cross-references the other documentation set
- Main project README now clearly explains both documentation sets

### 3. Created Documentation Map

- Added `DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md` at project root
- Provides clear guidelines on what content belongs where
- Helps prevent future duplication

### 4. Fixed Content Issues

- Updated installation instructions in public docs to use correct subdirectory path
- Removed duplicate `quick-start.md` file
- Updated quickstart guide to use simplified imports
- Ensured consistency between internal and public getting started guides

### 5. Improved Navigation

- Main README now has separate sections for user and contributor documentation
- Clear indication that public docs are live at docs.hokus.ai
- Better organization of content by audience

## Benefits

1. **No More Confusion**: Clear separation of internal vs public docs
2. **Better Maintenance**: Each doc set has a clear purpose and audience
3. **Reduced Duplication**: Guidelines prevent content overlap
4. **Improved Onboarding**: Users and contributors know exactly where to look

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Future Rename**: Consider renaming directories to `docs-internal` and `docs-public` for absolute clarity
2. **CI Integration**: Add checks to ensure documentation stays consistent
3. **Content Sync**: Some content (like version numbers) might benefit from automated sync

## Usage Guidelines

### For Contributors
- Use `/docs` for technical implementation details
- Reference `/documentation` when updating user-facing features

### For Documentation Writers
- User guides go in `/documentation`
- Technical specs go in `/docs`
- When in doubt, check `DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md`
