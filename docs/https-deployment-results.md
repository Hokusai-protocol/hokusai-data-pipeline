# HTTPS Deployment Results

## Deployment Status: ✅ Complete

HTTPS has been successfully deployed to the Hokusai development environment on 2025-07-16.

## What Was Deployed

1. **SSL Certificate**
   - Wildcard certificate for `*.hokus.ai` created in AWS ACM
   - Certificate ARN: `arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:932100697590:certificate/286ebcb3-218a-4f4d-8698-f70f283d51b4`
   - Validation: DNS validation via Namecheap

2. **Infrastructure Changes**
   - HTTPS listener added on port 443
   - HTTP listener updated to redirect to HTTPS
   - Certificate expiration monitoring configured
   - All HTTPS routing rules created

3. **Verified Working Endpoints**
   - `https://registry.hokus.ai/mlflow` ✅
   - `https://registry.hokus.ai/api` ✅
   - HTTP to HTTPS redirect ✅

## Configuration Applied

```hcl
# terraform.tfvars updates
environment = "development"
certificate_arn = "arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:932100697590:certificate/286ebcb3-218a-4f4d-8698-f70f283d51b4"
```

## DNS Configuration

No DNS changes were required. Existing CNAME records in Namecheap already point to the correct load balancer:
- `registry.hokus.ai` → `hokusai-development-794046971.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`

## Next Steps for Other Services

Other Hokusai services (auth.hokus.ai, www.hokus.ai) can use the same wildcard certificate:

1. Use certificate ARN: `arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:932100697590:certificate/286ebcb3-218a-4f4d-8698-f70f283d51b4`
2. Add HTTPS listener to their load balancer
3. Configure HTTP to HTTPS redirect
4. No additional certificate validation needed

## Monitoring

Certificate expiration alarm configured:
- Alarm Name: `hokusai-certificate-expiry-development`
- Threshold: 30 days before expiration
- Notification: SNS topic `hokusai-alerts-development`

## Important Notes

- The certificate auto-renews via ACM
- Keep DNS validation CNAME records in place for renewal
- Both HTTP and HTTPS are currently active (allows gradual migration)
- The same certificate can be used across multiple AWS load balancers in the same account/region
