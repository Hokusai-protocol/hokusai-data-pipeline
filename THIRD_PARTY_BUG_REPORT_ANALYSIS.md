# Third-Party Bug Report Analysis

**Date**: 2025-07-26  
**Reporter**: Third-party user attempting model registration  
**Analysis by**: Hokusai Development Team

## Executive Summary

The third-party user was following **outdated documentation** that referenced non-existent API endpoints. The actual issue is not with the platform infrastructure but with incorrect documentation in `/docs/third_party_integration_guide.md`.

## Key Findings

### 1. Documentation Issues Found

The third-party integration guide contained the following incorrect information:

| Incorrect Documentation | Correct Information |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| `/api/models/register` endpoint | This endpoint does not exist |
| `/api/models` endpoint | This endpoint does not exist |
| `http://registry.hokus.ai/mlflow` | Should be `https://registry.hokus.ai/api/mlflow` |
| Direct API registration endpoints | All operations go through MLflow proxy |

### 2. Working Infrastructure

Our testing confirmed:
- âœ… MLflow proxy endpoints are working correctly at `/api/mlflow/*`
- âœ… Model registration works through standard MLflow APIs
- âœ… Authentication works with proper headers
- âœ… PR #60 successfully deployed and functional

### 3. Actual Issues Remaining

1. **Missing Health Check Endpoints**: `/api/health/mlflow` returns 404
2. **Artifact Storage Issue**: MLflow artifacts endpoint returns HTML 404 instead of proper API error
3. **Authentication Documentation**: Need clearer instructions for MLflow client authentication

## Root Cause

The third-party user was misled by:
1. Documentation referencing endpoints that were never implemented (`/api/models/register`)
2. Incorrect MLflow tracking URI (missing `/api` prefix)
3. Examples showing direct API calls instead of MLflow client usage

## Actions Taken

### âœ… Completed
1. Fixed all incorrect endpoint references in `third_party_integration_guide.md`
2. Updated all examples to use correct tracking URI: `https://registry.hokus.ai/api/mlflow`
3. Added proper authentication configuration examples
4. Removed references to non-existent direct registration endpoints

### ðŸ”„ Pending
1. Implement missing health check endpoints
2. Fix artifact storage routing to return proper JSON errors
3. Update user-facing documentation in `/documentation` directory

## Correct Usage Example

```python
import os
import mlflow

# Configure authentication
os.environ["MLFLOW_TRACKING_TOKEN"] = "your_api_key_here"
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("https://registry.hokus.ai/api/mlflow")

# Register model using standard MLflow
with mlflow.start_run() as run:
    # Train and log model
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(
        model, 
        "model",
        registered_model_name="your_model_name"
    )
```

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Notify the third-party user about the correct endpoints
2. **Short-term**: Deploy health check endpoints to avoid confusion
3. **Medium-term**: Implement proper artifact storage routing
4. **Long-term**: Add endpoint validation tests to prevent documentation drift

## Response to Third-Party

Dear User,

Thank you for your detailed bug report. We've identified that you were following outdated documentation. The endpoints `/api/models/register` and `/api/models` mentioned in our guide **do not exist** and were documented in error.

### Correct Approach:

1. Use MLflow tracking URI: `https://registry.hokus.ai/api/mlflow`
2. Set authentication: `os.environ["MLFLOW_TRACKING_TOKEN"] = "your_api_key"`
3. Use standard MLflow client for all operations

The documentation has been updated. Model registration works correctly through the MLflow proxy endpoints, which have been operational since PR #60 was deployed on 2025-07-24.

We apologize for the confusion caused by the incorrect documentation.
