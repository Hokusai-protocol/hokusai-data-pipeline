# Product Requirements Document: Integrate DSPy with MLflow Tracing

## Objectives

This feature integrates DSPy program execution with MLflow's tracing capabilities to provide comprehensive visibility into prompt-based model operations. By wrapping all DSPy executions with automatic MLflow tracing, we enable detailed tracking of inputs, intermediate outputs, and final results throughout the DSPy program lifecycle.

Key objectives:
1. Automatically enable MLflow tracing for all DSPy program executions
2. Capture complete execution traces including inputs, outputs, and intermediate steps
3. Ensure module names and signatures are traceable in MLflow UI
4. Provide seamless integration without requiring code changes in existing DSPy programs
5. Enable performance monitoring and debugging of DSPy pipelines

## Personas

### Primary Users
- **ML Engineers**: Monitor and debug DSPy program performance in production
- **Data Scientists**: Analyze prompt effectiveness and model behavior
- **Platform Engineers**: Ensure system reliability and performance

### Secondary Users
- **Product Managers**: Review model performance metrics and user interactions
- **DevOps Engineers**: Monitor system health and troubleshoot issues

## Success Criteria

1. **Automatic Tracing**
   - All DSPy executions automatically log to MLflow without manual instrumentation
   - Zero configuration required for basic tracing functionality
   - Support for custom trace metadata and tags

2. **Complete Visibility**
   - Capture 100% of DSPy program executions
   - Log all inputs, outputs, and intermediate transformations
   - Track execution time and resource usage
   - Preserve module hierarchy and signature information

3. **Performance Impact**
   - Less than 5% overhead on execution time
   - Minimal memory footprint for trace storage
   - Configurable sampling for high-volume scenarios

4. **Integration Quality**
   - Compatible with existing DSPy programs without modifications
   - Works with all DSPy module types and signatures
   - Integrates with existing MLflow experiments and runs
