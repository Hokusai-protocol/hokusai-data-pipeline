# Product Requirements Document: Fix MLflow Authentication Error

## Objectives

Resolve the critical MLflow authentication error (HTTP 403) that is preventing third-party users from registering models through the Hokusai ML platform. This blocker prevents production deployment and model registration workflows.

## Personas

- **Third-party developers**: External users attempting to register and deploy models using the Hokusai platform
- **Data scientists**: Users who need to track experiments and register models in MLflow
- **Platform administrators**: Teams managing the Hokusai infrastructure and authentication

## Success Criteria

1. Model registration completes successfully without authentication errors
2. MLflow tracking server accepts API requests with proper authentication
3. Both local and remote MLflow deployments are supported
4. Clear documentation exists for authentication configuration
5. Fallback mechanisms available when MLflow is unavailable

## Technical Requirements

### Authentication Configuration
- Support multiple authentication methods (API key, OAuth, basic auth)
- Environment variable configuration for MLflow credentials
- Secure storage of authentication tokens
- Automatic retry with authentication refresh

### MLflow Integration
- Configure MLflow client with proper authentication headers
- Support both hosted and self-hosted MLflow servers
- Handle authentication for all MLflow API endpoints
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing code

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when MLflow is unavailable
- Clear error messages indicating authentication issues
- Logging of authentication attempts for debugging
- Fallback to local model storage when needed

### Documentation
- Configuration guide for MLflow authentication
- Environment variable reference
- Troubleshooting guide for common auth issues
- Example configurations for different deployment scenarios

## Implementation Tasks

### Core Authentication Fix
- Diagnose root cause of 403 errors in MLflow client
- Implement authentication header injection
- Add configuration for MLflow tracking URI and credentials
- Create authentication wrapper for MLflow client

### Fallback Mechanisms
- Implement local model registry fallback
- Create offline mode for development
- Add mock MLflow server for testing
- Enable registry operations without MLflow dependency

### Testing and Validation
- Unit tests for authentication flows
- Integration tests with MLflow server
- Mock authentication scenarios
- End-to-end model registration tests

### Documentation and Examples
- Update SDK documentation with auth setup
- Create authentication quickstart guide
- Add troubleshooting section
- Provide example configurations
