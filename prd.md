# Product Requirements Document: Metric Logging Convention

## Objective
Establish a standardized convention for tracking usage-based metrics across the Hokusai platform using MLflow's logging methods, ensuring consistent metric tracking and retrieval.

## Problem Statement
Currently, there's no standardized approach for logging usage-based metrics like reply_rate or conversion_rate. This leads to:
- Inconsistent metric naming across different models and experiments
- Difficulty in aggregating and comparing metrics across the platform
- Challenges in tracking performance improvements over time
- No clear guidelines for developers on how to log custom metrics

## Solution Overview
Implement a comprehensive metric logging convention that:
1. Defines standard naming patterns for common metrics
2. Provides utility functions for consistent metric logging
3. Establishes best practices for metric organization
4. Integrates seamlessly with existing MLflow infrastructure

## Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Standard Metric Naming**
   - Define naming conventions for usage-based metrics
   - Support hierarchical metric organization (e.g., "metric:reply_rate")
   - Ensure compatibility with MLflow's metric naming rules
   - Support both global and model-specific metrics

2. **Logging Utilities**
   - Create helper functions for common metric logging patterns
   - Support batch metric logging for efficiency
   - Provide validation for metric names and values
   - Enable automatic timestamping and versioning

3. **Metric Organization**
   - Support metric prefixes for categorization
   - Enable metric grouping by model, experiment, or feature
   - Provide search and filtering capabilities
   - Support metric metadata and descriptions

### Technical Requirements
1. **MLflow Integration**
   - Use native MLflow logging methods
   - Ensure compatibility with MLflow UI and API
   - Support both real-time and batch logging
   - Work with existing experiment tracking

2. **Performance**
   - Minimize logging overhead
   - Support asynchronous metric logging
   - Enable metric aggregation and caching
   - Handle high-frequency metric updates

## Implementation Details

### Metric Naming Convention
```python
# Format: [category:]metric_name[.submetric]
# Examples:
"usage:reply_rate"           # Usage metric
"model:accuracy"             # Model performance metric
"pipeline:processing_time"   # Pipeline metric
"custom:user_engagement"     # Custom metric
```

### Standard Metrics
```python
STANDARD_METRICS = {
    # Usage metrics
    "usage:reply_rate": "Rate of replies to messages",
    "usage:conversion_rate": "Conversion rate for actions",
    "usage:engagement_rate": "User engagement rate",
    
    # Model metrics
    "model:accuracy": "Model accuracy score",
    "model:f1_score": "F1 score",
    "model:latency_ms": "Inference latency in milliseconds",
    
    # Pipeline metrics
    "pipeline:data_processed": "Amount of data processed",
    "pipeline:success_rate": "Pipeline success rate",
    "pipeline:duration_seconds": "Pipeline execution time"
}
```

### Logging API
```python
# Simple metric logging
log_metric("reply_rate", 0.1523)

# With prefix
log_metric("usage:reply_rate", 0.1523)

# Batch logging
log_metrics({
    "usage:reply_rate": 0.1523,
    "usage:conversion_rate": 0.0821,
    "model:accuracy": 0.8934
})

# With metadata
log_metric_with_metadata(
    name="usage:reply_rate",
    value=0.1523,
    metadata={
        "model_version": "2.0.1",
        "experiment": "baseline_comparison",
        "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
)
```

## Success Criteria
1. All platform components use standardized metric naming
2. Metrics are easily searchable and comparable across experiments
3. Clear documentation and examples available
4. Backward compatibility maintained
5. Improved metric visibility in MLflow UI

## Deliverables
1. Metric logging utility module
2. Standard metric definitions and naming guide
3. Integration with existing pipeline and model registry
4. Unit tests for metric logging functionality
5. Documentation and migration guide
6. Example implementations in pipeline code
