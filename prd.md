# Product Requirements Document: Unified MLOps Service Architecture

## Objectives

Transform the hokusai-data-pipeline from a verification tool into a comprehensive MLOps platform that provides shared services across the entire Hokusai ecosystem. This will enable centralized model management, verifiable improvement tracking, and automated attestation generation for all model improvements.

Key objectives:
- Create a unified model registry for all Hokusai projects
- Implement performance tracking with automated attestation
- Build experiment orchestration capabilities
- Provide API endpoints for external integrations
- Enable cross-project model sharing and improvement tracking

## Personas

### Primary Users
- **ML Engineers**: Need to register, track, and compare models across projects
- **Data Contributors**: Want to see the impact of their contributions on model performance
- **GTM-Agent Developers**: Require API access to model registry and performance metrics
- **DevOps Engineers**: Need to deploy and maintain the MLOps infrastructure

### Secondary Users
- **Project Managers**: Track model improvement progress across teams
- **Compliance Officers**: Verify contributor attribution and model lineage

## Success Criteria

1. **Technical Success**
   - All models registered in a single MLFlow-based registry
   - Automated performance delta calculation and attestation generation
   - API response time < 500ms for model queries
   - Support for concurrent experiment tracking across multiple projects
   - Complete model lineage tracking from baseline to current version

2. **Adoption Success**
   - GTM-agent successfully integrated with the unified registry
   - At least 3 Hokusai projects using the shared services
   - 90% of model improvements tracked with contributor attribution
   - Zero data loss or model registry downtime

3. **Operational Success**
   - Automated deployment via Docker Compose
   - Comprehensive API documentation
   - Monitoring and alerting for all services
   - Backup and recovery procedures in place

## Implementation Tasks

- Add model registry API service configuration
- Create environment configuration templates
- Write infrastructure setup documentation

### Task 5: Enhance Metaflow Pipeline Integration
- Update existing Metaflow steps to use new services
- Add `register_baseline` step to pipeline
- Implement `track_improvement` step with attestation
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing pipeline
- Update pipeline configuration for service endpoints
- Write integration tests for enhanced pipeline

### Task 6: Create API Endpoints
- Create `hokusai_data_pipeline/api/` directory structure
- Implement `/models/{model_id}/lineage` endpoint
- Implement `/models/register` endpoint
- Implement `/contributors/{address}/impact` endpoint
- Add API authentication and rate limiting
- Generate OpenAPI documentation

### Task 7: Implement Data Models and Schemas
- Create Pydantic models for API requests/responses
- Define database schemas for model registry
- Create migration scripts for database setup
- Implement data validation for all inputs
- Add schema versioning support

### Task 8: Add Monitoring and Logging
- Implement structured logging across all services
- Add metrics collection for service performance
- Create health check endpoints
- Set up error tracking and alerting
- Add audit logging for model changes

### Task 9: Create Integration Tests
- Write end-to-end tests for complete workflow
- Test model registration and retrieval
- Test performance tracking and attestation
- Test API endpoints with mock data
- Create load testing scenarios

### Task 10: Documentation and Deployment
- Write API documentation with examples
- Create deployment guide for production
- Document backup and recovery procedures
- Create troubleshooting guide
- Write migration guide for existing models

## Technical Constraints

- Must integrate with existing Metaflow pipeline without breaking changes
- MLFlow server must support PostgreSQL backend
- API must be RESTful and follow OpenAPI specification
- All services must be containerized
- Must support horizontal scaling for API services

## Dependencies

- Existing hokusai-data-pipeline codebase
- MLFlow 2.x
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI for API services
- Metaflow integration points

## Risk Mitigation

- **Data Loss**: Implement automated backups and point-in-time recovery
- **Service Downtime**: Use health checks and automatic container restarts
- **Integration Failures**: Extensive testing and gradual rollout
- **Performance Issues**: Load testing and horizontal scaling capabilities
- **Security Concerns**: API authentication and audit logging
