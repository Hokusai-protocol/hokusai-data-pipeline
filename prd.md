# Product Requirements Document: MLflow Server Connection Error Fix

## Objectives

The primary objective is to resolve the MLflow server connection error (HTTP 403 Forbidden) that prevents the Hokusai ML platform's ExperimentManager from connecting to the MLflow tracking server. This fix will enable third-party developers to successfully use the Hokusai SDK for model registration and experiment tracking.

## Personas

1. **Third-Party Developers**: External developers integrating Hokusai SDK into their ML projects who need reliable MLflow connectivity for experiment tracking and model registration.

2. **Data Scientists**: Users who need to track experiments, register models, and monitor performance metrics through the Hokusai platform.

3. **DevOps Engineers**: Team members responsible for deploying and maintaining the Hokusai infrastructure, including MLflow server configuration.

## Success Criteria

1. ExperimentManager successfully connects to MLflow server without authentication errors
2. All MLflow API endpoints are accessible through the platform
3. Local development mode works without requiring MLflow server connection
4. Clear documentation exists for MLflow configuration
5. Automated tests verify MLflow connectivity and error handling

## Tasks

### 1. Fix Authentication Middleware
- Modify the authentication middleware to exclude MLflow endpoints from API key authentication
- Ensure MLflow paths (/mlflow/*) bypass the standard authentication flow
- Maintain security for other API endpoints

### 2. Implement MLflow Proxy Router
- Create a reverse proxy to forward MLflow requests from registry.hokus.ai to the internal MLflow server
- Strip authentication headers before forwarding to MLflow
- Preserve all MLflow functionality (UI, API, SDK integration)

### 3. Update SDK Configuration
- Modify ExperimentManager to use the correct MLflow tracking URI
- Add environment variable support for MLflow configuration
- Implement fallback mechanism for local development

### 4. Add Local/Mock Mode
- Create a local mode that doesn't require MLflow server connection
- Implement mock tracking functionality for testing
- Allow developers to disable MLflow integration via configuration

### 5. Update Documentation
- Document MLflow configuration requirements
- Create setup guide for third-party developers
- Add troubleshooting section for common connection issues
- Update API reference with MLflow endpoints

### 6. Implement Comprehensive Tests
- Write unit tests for authentication middleware changes
- Create integration tests for MLflow connectivity
- Add test script for verifying MLflow server access
- Test both authenticated and unauthenticated paths

### 7. Error Handling Improvements
- Implement graceful error handling for MLflow connection failures
- Provide clear error messages with troubleshooting steps
- Add retry logic for transient connection issues
