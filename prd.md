# Analysis: Model Registration Without MLflow

## Problem Statement

When MLflow integration fails, there's no clear fallback mechanism for model registration. The platform should support model registration even when MLflow is unavailable or misconfigured.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Fallback Mechanisms
- **Mock Mode**: `HOKUSAI_MOCK_MODE` environment variable bypasses MLflow entirely
- **API Registration**: `register_baseline_via_api()` method provides alternative path
- **Retry Logic**: Basic retry mechanisms for transient connection errors
- **Error Handling**: Generic exception handling with logging

### MLflow Dependencies
- **Core Registration**: `ModelRegistry` class heavily depends on `MlflowClient`
- **Experiment Tracking**: `ExperimentManager` requires MLflow connection
- **Metrics Storage**: Performance metrics stored in MLflow
- **Artifact Management**: Model artifacts managed through MLflow

## Options Analysis

### Option 1: High Availability MLflow (Recommended)
**Approach**: Focus on making MLflow itself highly available rather than building fallback systems.

**Pros**:
- Simpler architecture - one source of truth
- Existing MLflow ecosystem and tooling
- No data consistency issues
- Lower development and maintenance cost

**Implementation**:
- **MLflow HA Setup**: Multi-instance MLflow with load balancer
- **Database Redundancy**: PostgreSQL with replication
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and alerting
- **Backup/Recovery**: Automated backups and disaster recovery

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks
**Estimated Cost**: $500-1000/month for infrastructure

### Option 2: Lightweight Fallback System
**Approach**: Build minimal fallback using existing database infrastructure.

**Pros**:
- Provides resilience during MLflow outages
- Uses existing PostgreSQL database
- Minimal additional infrastructure

**Implementation**:
- **Simple Registry Table**: Store basic model metadata in existing DB
- **Queue System**: Queue registrations for MLflow sync when available
- **Health Monitoring**: Simple MLflow availability checks

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks
**Estimated Cost**: Minimal additional infrastructure cost

### Option 3: Full Fallback System (Not Recommended)
**Approach**: Complete mirror of MLflow functionality in local database.

**Cons**:
- High complexity and maintenance burden
- Data consistency challenges
- Duplicate infrastructure
- Feature parity challenges with MLflow updates

**Estimated Effort**: 8-12 weeks
**Estimated Cost**: Significant ongoing maintenance

## Recommendation

**Choose Option 1: High Availability MLflow**

### Rationale
1. **Simplicity**: One system to maintain rather than two
2. **Reliability**: MLflow is mature and battle-tested
3. **Cost-Effective**: Infrastructure costs are lower than development time
4. **Future-Proof**: Leverages MLflow's ongoing development

### Implementation Plan
1. **Week 1**: Set up MLflow HA infrastructure
2. **Week 2**: Implement monitoring and alerting
3. **Week 3**: Add backup/recovery procedures and testing

### Quick Wins (Immediate)
While setting up HA infrastructure, improve current error handling:
- **Better Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Circuit Breaker**: Fail fast when MLflow is definitively down
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages about MLflow status

## Success Metrics
- **Uptime**: Target 99.9% MLflow availability
- **MTTR**: Mean time to recovery < 5 minutes
- **Error Rate**: Reduce MLflow-related errors by 90%

## Decision Required
Should we proceed with Option 1 (High Availability MLflow) or do you prefer a different approach?
