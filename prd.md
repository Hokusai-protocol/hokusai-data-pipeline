# Product Requirements Document: Add Teleprompt Fine-tuning Pipeline

## Objectives

Create a pipeline that automatically recompiles and optimizes DSPy programs using the teleprompt.compile() functionality based on logged usage data and outcomes. This enables continuous improvement of prompt-based models by learning from real-world usage patterns and performance metrics. **Critically, the pipeline must generate attestations when optimized models achieve DeltaOne improvements (≥1% improvement over baseline).**

Key objectives:
1. Accept labeled traces from production usage (prompt + reply + outcome scores)
2. Use teleprompt.compile() to optimize DSPy programs based on actual performance
3. Output updated, optimized DSPy programs with improved prompts
4. Store new versions with metadata in MLflow registry
5. Enable automated fine-tuning cycles based on accumulated usage data
6. **Generate attestation-ready outputs when DeltaOne threshold is reached**
7. **Track contributor attribution for data used in optimization**

## Personas

### Primary Users
- **ML Engineers**: Configure and monitor the fine-tuning pipeline
