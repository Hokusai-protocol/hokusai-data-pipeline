# Product Requirements Document: Deploy HTTPS for Hokusai

## Objectives

Enable HTTPS for all Hokusai domains (api.hokus.ai, www.hokus.ai, auth.hokus.ai) to ensure secure communication and meet security requirements for API key transmission and model data protection.

## Personas

- **DevOps Engineer**: Responsible for infrastructure and certificate management
- **API Developers**: Need secure endpoints for model registration and data transmission
- **End Users**: Require secure access to web interfaces and API endpoints
- **Third-party Integrators**: Need trusted HTTPS connections for production deployments

## Success Criteria

1. All Hokusai domains accessible via HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
2. HTTP traffic automatically redirected to HTTPS
3. No disruption to existing services during migration
4. SSL certificates properly configured for auto-renewal
5. Documentation updated with HTTPS endpoints

## Tasks

### Certificate Management
- Request SSL certificates via AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for all domains
- Validate domain ownership through DNS or email validation
- Configure certificate auto-renewal policies

### Infrastructure Updates
- Update Terraform configuration with certificate ARNs
- Configure ALB/ELB listeners for HTTPS (port 443)
- Set up HTTP to HTTPS redirect rules
- Apply Terraform changes to production infrastructure

### DNS Configuration
- Update Route53 records to point to HTTPS-enabled load balancers
- Ensure proper CNAME/A records for all subdomains
- Configure health checks for HTTPS endpoints

### Cross-Repository Coordination
- Document HTTPS migration process for repositories not in this codebase
- Provide implementation guide for auth.hokus.ai team
- Create shared certificate management strategy

### Testing and Validation
- Verify SSL certificate chain validity
- Test HTTP to HTTPS redirects
- Confirm API functionality over HTTPS
- Validate certificate renewal process

### Documentation Updates
- Update all documentation to use HTTPS URLs
- Document certificate management procedures
- Create runbook for SSL certificate issues
