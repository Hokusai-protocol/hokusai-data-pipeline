# Product Requirements Document: DSPy Pipeline Executor

## Objectives

The DSPy Pipeline Executor provides a runtime environment for executing DSPy programs within the Hokusai ML platform. This component will bridge the gap between loaded DSPy models and actual inference execution, enabling:

1. Structured execution of DSPy programs with input validation
2. Comprehensive logging of intermediate steps and outputs
3. Integration with MLflow for experiment tracking and tracing
4. Standardized API for DSPy program invocation across the platform

## Personas

### Primary Users
- **ML Engineers**: Execute and test DSPy programs with various inputs, track performance metrics
- **Data Scientists**: Run experiments with DSPy models, analyze intermediate outputs
- **Platform Developers**: Integrate DSPy execution into larger pipelines and services

### Secondary Users
- **DevOps Engineers**: Monitor DSPy execution performance and resource usage
- **Product Teams**: Access DSPy model outputs through standardized APIs

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional Success**
   - Execute any valid DSPy program loaded through the DSPyModelLoader
   - Capture all intermediate outputs from DSPy execution chains
   - Log execution traces to MLflow automatically
   - Handle errors gracefully with detailed error messages

2. **Performance Success**
   - Execute DSPy programs with <100ms overhead
   - Support concurrent execution of multiple DSPy programs
   - Efficient memory usage for large input/output data

3. **Integration Success**
   - Seamless integration with existing MLflow tracking
   - Compatible with all DSPy program types (single/multi-signature)
   - Works with token-aware model registry

## Tasks

### Core Executor Implementation
1. Create `DSPyPipelineExecutor` class in `src/services/dspy_pipeline_executor.py`
   - Accept DSPy program instances or model IDs
   - Validate input dictionaries against program signatures
   - Execute programs and capture outputs
   - Handle execution errors with context

2. Input/Output Processing
   - Implement input validation against DSPy signatures
   - Support multiple input formats (dict, JSON, structured objects)
   - Standardize output format with metadata
   - Type conversion and serialization handling

3. MLflow Integration
   - Automatic `mlflow.dspy.autolog()` initialization
   - Log program metadata (signatures, configuration)
   - Track intermediate outputs from execution chains
   - Record execution timing and resource usage

4. Execution Modes
   - Synchronous execution for immediate results
   - Batch execution for multiple inputs
   - Dry-run mode for validation without execution
   - Debug mode with verbose intermediate logging

5. Error Handling and Recovery
   - Graceful handling of DSPy execution failures
   - Detailed error messages with signature context
   - Retry logic for transient failures
   - Fallback mechanisms for partial execution

6. Monitoring and Observability
   - Execution metrics (latency, throughput, success rate)
   - Resource usage tracking (memory, CPU)
   - Detailed execution logs with trace IDs
   - Integration with platform monitoring tools

7. API Design
   - RESTful endpoint for DSPy execution
   - Python client interface for programmatic access
   - Batch execution endpoints
   - Status and result retrieval APIs

### Configuration and Management
1. Executor configuration options
   - Timeout settings per execution
   - Resource limits (memory, CPU)
   - MLflow tracking configuration
   - Logging verbosity levels

2. Caching and Optimization
   - Cache loaded DSPy programs
   - Result caching for identical inputs
   - Connection pooling for external services
   - Lazy loading of program dependencies

### Integration Points
1. Integration with DSPyModelLoader
   - Load programs by model ID
   - Access program metadata
   - Version compatibility checking

2. Integration with Model Registry
   - Track execution against registered models
   - Update model usage metrics
   - Link executions to model versions

3. Integration with existing pipelines
   - Metaflow step integration
   - API service integration
   - Batch processing integration
