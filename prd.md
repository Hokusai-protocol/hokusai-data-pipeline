# Product Requirements Document: Investigate Registration Issues

## Objectives

Resolve critical API mismatches and authentication issues preventing third-party developers from successfully registering models on the Hokusai platform. Ensure the hokusai-ml-platform package provides a consistent, well-documented API that matches implementation.

## Personas

**Third-Party Developer**: Data scientists and ML engineers integrating their models with Hokusai platform for token-based rewards. They expect clear documentation, predictable APIs, and proper error handling.

**Hokusai Platform Team**: Internal developers maintaining the platform who need visibility into integration issues and ability to support external users.

## Success Criteria

1. All documented API methods match actual implementation
2. MLflow authentication is properly configured or made optional
3. Model registration completes successfully without authentication errors
4. Missing methods are implemented or documentation is updated
5. Clear error messages guide users to resolution
6. Integration test suite validates public API contract

## Technical Requirements

### Issue 1: MLflow Authentication Error (Critical)
- ExperimentManager fails with 403 authentication error when connecting to MLflow
- API request to /api/2.0/mlflow/experiments/get-by-name returns 403
- Blocks experiment tracking and model versioning workflows

### Issue 2: ModelRegistry.register_baseline() API Mismatch
- Method signature doesn't accept 'model_name' parameter as documented
- Current implementation has different parameter names than expected

### Issue 3: ModelVersionManager Missing Methods
- Missing get_latest_version(model_name)
- Missing list_versions(model_name)
- Cannot query model versions programmatically

### Issue 4: HokusaiInferencePipeline Missing Methods
- Missing predict_batch(data, model_name, model_version)
- Limits production use cases requiring batch processing

### Issue 5: PerformanceTracker Missing Methods
- Missing track_inference(metrics)
- Cannot monitor model performance in production

## Implementation Tasks

### Authentication & Configuration
- Implement MLflow authentication configuration
- Add support for optional MLflow integration (local mode)
- Document required environment variables and setup

### API Consistency
- Audit all public methods against documentation
- Fix method signatures to match documentation
- Implement missing methods or update docs

### Error Handling
- Add descriptive error messages for common issues
- Implement fallback mechanisms for MLflow unavailability
- Guide users to correct configuration

### Testing & Validation
- Create integration tests for public API
- Add contract tests to prevent future breakage
- Include example scripts demonstrating proper usage

### Documentation
- Update API reference with correct signatures
- Add troubleshooting guide for common errors
- Include complete setup instructions with authentication
