# Product Requirements Document: Package Installation

## Objectives

Enable external projects to easily install and use the hokusai-ml-platform package by establishing a robust distribution strategy and clear installation process. This will allow private repositories to integrate Hokusai's ML capabilities while providing a path to public PyPI availability.

## Personas

**External Developer**: A junior to mid-level developer working on a project that needs to integrate Hokusai's ML capabilities. They need clear documentation and simple installation commands.

**DevOps Engineer**: Responsible for setting up CI/CD pipelines and managing package dependencies in production environments. They need reliable, versioned packages.

## Success Criteria

1. External developers can install hokusai-ml-platform with a single pip command
2. Package is available through at least one distribution channel (PyPI, GitHub, or private registry)
3. Documentation clearly explains installation for different use cases
4. Version management allows for stable releases and updates
5. Package can be successfully installed and imported in external projects

## Tasks

### 1. Package Distribution Setup

Configure the hokusai-ml-platform package for distribution through multiple channels:
- Set up GitHub releases with automated package building
- Prepare for PyPI publication with proper metadata
- Document private repository installation methods

### 2. Build and Release Pipeline

Create automated CI/CD for package releases:
- Configure GitHub Actions for package building and testing
- Set up automated version tagging and changelog generation
- Implement pre-release testing workflow

### 3. Installation Documentation

Create comprehensive installation guides:
- Quick start guide for basic pip installation
- Advanced installation for different environments
- Troubleshooting common installation issues
- Migration guide from local development to package usage

### 4. Private Repository Support

Document and test private repository installation:
- GitHub installation with authentication
- Git submodule approach for tight integration
- Private PyPI server setup instructions

### 5. PyPI Publication Preparation

Prepare package for public PyPI release:
- Ensure all package metadata is complete
- Add proper classifiers and keywords
- Create PyPI account and API tokens
- Document security considerations

### 6. Version Management

Establish clear versioning strategy:
- Semantic versioning implementation
- Backward compatibility policies
- Deprecation procedures
- Release notes automation

### 7. Integration Examples

Create example projects showing package usage:
- Basic ML model improvement example
- Complete end-to-end workflow
- Common integration patterns
- Dependency management best practices

### 8. Testing Package Installation

Verify package works correctly when installed:
- Test installation from GitHub
- Test editable installation for development
- Verify all dependencies are correctly specified
- Ensure package imports work as expected
