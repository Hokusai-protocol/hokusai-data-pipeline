# Product Requirements Document: Integrate Contributed Data Step

## Objective

Implement a robust `integrate_contributed_data` step in the Hokusai evaluation pipeline that merges submitted datasets with the training set. This step enables contributors to submit their own data for model improvement while maintaining data quality, validation, and pipeline integrity.

## Personas

**Primary Users:**
- Pipeline Engineers: Need to integrate contributed data into the training workflow
- Data Scientists: Require data validation and quality assurance for contributed datasets
- ML Engineers: Need clean, properly formatted data for model training

**Secondary Users:**
- Contributors: Submit datasets that need to be integrated into the pipeline
- DevOps Engineers: Monitor data integration performance and errors
- Quality Assurance: Validate data integration functionality across environments

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- Successfully load datasets from various sources (file paths, blob storage)
- Validate dataset schema and format compatibility
- Merge contributed data with existing training datasets
- Support multiple data formats (JSON, CSV, Parquet)
- Implement data cleaning and deduplication capabilities
- Provide optional data shuffling for training optimization
- Handle large datasets efficiently without memory overflow
- Pass integrated dataset downstream to training steps

### Performance Requirements
- Process datasets up to 10GB within 15 minutes
- Memory usage remains below 8GB during integration
- Support concurrent data loading from multiple sources
- Maintain data integrity throughout the integration process

### Reliability Requirements
- 99.9% success rate for valid data integration requests
- Graceful handling of malformed or corrupted data
- Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging
- Rollback capability for failed integrations

## Technical Specifications

### Core Functionality
1. **Data Loading**: Load datasets from local file system or blob storage
2. **Schema Validation**: Verify data schema matches expected format
3. **Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, validate data types
4. **Data Merging**: Combine contributed data with existing training dataset
5. **Data Shuffling**: Optional randomization for training optimization
6. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with detailed error messages
7. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging

### Input Parameters
- `data_source`: Source type (local_path, blob_storage, url)
- `data_path`: Path or URL to the contributed dataset
- `schema_config`: Expected data schema configuration
- `merge_strategy`: How to combine with existing data (append, interleave, weighted)
- `validation_config`: Data validation parameters
- `cleaning_config`: Data cleaning options (dedupe, shuffle, etc.)

### Output
- Integrated dataset ready for model training
- Data integration metadata (row counts, validation results)
- Integration statistics and quality metrics

## Implementation Tasks

### Core Development
1. Create `data_integration.py` module with `integrate_contributed_data` function
2. Implement data loading from multiple sources (local, blob storage)
3. Add schema validation framework
4. Build data cleaning and deduplication capabilities
5. Implement data merging strategies
6. Add optional data shuffling functionality
7. Implement comprehensive error handling
8. Add structured logging throughout the module

### Testing
1. Create unit tests for data loading from different sources
2. Add unit tests for schema validation
3. Implement tests for data cleaning and deduplication
4. Create tests for data merging strategies
5. Add tests for error scenarios (malformed data, schema mismatches)
6. Implement performance tests for large datasets

### Documentation
1. Update module docstrings with usage examples
2. Add inline comments for complex logic
3. Document configuration parameters and schemas

### Integration
1. Integrate with existing Metaflow pipeline structure
2. Ensure compatibility with MLFlow tracking setup
3. Add proper logging integration with pipeline monitoring
4. Connect output to train_new_model step

## Dependencies

- Pandas for data manipulation
- PyArrow for Parquet file support
- Metaflow framework
- MLFlow for experiment tracking
- Python logging module
- Cloud storage libraries (boto3 for S3, azure-storage-blob for Azure)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Large Dataset Handling**: Implement chunked processing for large files
- **Memory Management**: Use streaming/iterative processing to avoid memory overflow
- **Data Quality**: Comprehensive validation and cleaning pipelines
- **Schema Evolution**: Flexible schema validation with versioning support
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure no sensitive data logging or exposure
