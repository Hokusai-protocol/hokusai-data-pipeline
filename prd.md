# Product Requirements Document: Update Hokusai API Proxy

## Objective
Update the Hokusai API proxy to properly handle authentication by accepting Bearer token headers and forwarding requests to MLflow without authentication requirements. This will enable seamless integration of the standard MLflow client with Hokusai authentication.

## Background
The current implementation has authentication issues that prevent third-party model registration. Users encounter 403 errors when attempting to use MLflow through the Hokusai platform. The solution requires updating the proxy layer to handle Bearer token authentication and properly forward requests to the MLflow backend.

## User Personas
1. **Data Scientists**: Need to register and track models using standard MLflow client
2. **Third-party Developers**: Require seamless API access for model registration
3. **Platform Administrators**: Need secure and maintainable authentication flow

## Success Criteria
1. API proxy accepts `Authorization: Bearer <api-key>` headers
2. Bearer tokens are validated as Hokusai API keys
3. Requests are forwarded to MLflow without authentication headers
4. Standard MLflow client works without modification
5. Existing authentication mechanisms remain functional
6. No breaking changes to current API contracts

## Technical Requirements

### Authentication Flow
1. Receive request with Bearer token in Authorization header
2. Extract and validate token as Hokusai API key
3. Strip authentication header before forwarding to MLflow
4. Return MLflow response to client

### Implementation Tasks
1. Locate and analyze current API proxy implementation
2. Add Bearer token parsing middleware
3. Implement Hokusai API key validation
4. Configure request forwarding without auth headers
5. Add comprehensive error handling
6. Write unit and integration tests
7. Update API documentation
8. Test with real MLflow client scenarios

### Security Considerations
- Validate all incoming API keys against Hokusai's key store
- Log authentication attempts for security monitoring
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Ensure no credentials are leaked in error messages

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for token parsing and validation
- Integration tests with MLflow client
- End-to-end tests for model registration flow
- Performance tests under load
- Security tests for invalid tokens

## Dependencies
- Access to current API proxy codebase
- Understanding of Hokusai API key structure
- MLflow client for testing
- Test environment with MLflow backend

## Timeline
This is a high-priority fix that blocks third-party integrations. Implementation should be completed within one development cycle.
