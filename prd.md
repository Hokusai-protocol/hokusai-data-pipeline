# Product Requirements Document: Update Hokusai Documentation

## Objectives

The primary objective is to create comprehensive documentation for the Hokusai data pipeline that enables users to understand and use the system from end-to-end. The documentation should be formatted as markdown files compatible with Docusaurus for integration into the docs.hokus.ai website.

## Personas

### Primary Users
- **ML Engineers**: Need to understand how to integrate the pipeline into their model training workflow
- **Data Contributors**: Need to know how to prepare and submit data for model improvement
- **DevOps Engineers**: Need to deploy and maintain the pipeline infrastructure
- **Developers**: Need to integrate with the pipeline API and understand output formats

### Secondary Users
- **Product Managers**: Need to understand pipeline capabilities and limitations
- **Security Auditors**: Need to verify data handling and attestation mechanisms

## Success Criteria

1. Complete documentation covering all pipeline modules and features
2. Clear step-by-step guides for common use cases
3. API reference documentation for all public interfaces
4. Architecture diagrams explaining data flow and system components
5. Troubleshooting guides for common issues
6. All documentation formatted for Docusaurus compatibility
7. Documentation validated against current codebase functionality

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Audit Existing Documentation
- Review current README.md and all docs/*.md files in the repository
- Review existing documentation at https://docs.hokus.ai/, particularly:
  - The "Supplying Data" section at https://docs.hokus.ai/supplying-data
  - Other relevant sections for pipeline usage and integration
- Identify gaps between documented and actual functionality
- Create inventory of undocumented features and modules
- Note areas requiring clarification or expansion

### Task 2: Create Documentation Structure
- Design information architecture for docs.hokus.ai
- Create documentation categories (Getting Started, Architecture, API Reference, etc.)
- Define navigation structure and page hierarchy
- Create template for consistent documentation format

### Task 3: Write Core Documentation
- **Getting Started Guide**: Installation, setup, and first pipeline run
- **Architecture Overview**: System components, data flow, and design decisions
- **Pipeline Configuration**: All configuration options and environment variables
- **Data Contribution Guide**: Data formats, validation requirements, and submission process
- **Model Integration Guide**: How to integrate baseline and new models
- **Output Format Reference**: Detailed schema for attestation-ready outputs

### Task 4: Create API Reference Documentation
- Document all public Python modules and classes
- Include function signatures, parameters, and return values
- Add code examples for common usage patterns
- Document error codes and exception handling

### Task 5: Write Operations Documentation
- **Deployment Guide**: Production deployment requirements and steps
- **Monitoring Guide**: MLFlow integration and pipeline monitoring
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimization for high-throughput scenarios
- **Security Guide**: Data handling, PII protection, and access control

### Task 6: Create Tutorials and Examples
- **Tutorial 1**: Running pipeline in dry-run mode
- **Tutorial 2**: Contributing data to improve a model
- **Tutorial 3**: Integrating with HuggingFace datasets
- **Tutorial 4**: Generating attestation proofs
- **Example Code**: Complete working examples for common scenarios

### Task 7: Add Troubleshooting Documentation
- Common error messages and solutions
- Debugging techniques for pipeline issues
- FAQ section based on known issues
- Performance troubleshooting guide

### Task 8: Create Developer Documentation
- Contributing guidelines
- Testing documentation (unit and integration tests)
- Code style and best practices
- Extension points and customization options

### Task 9: Format for Docusaurus
- Convert all markdown to Docusaurus-compatible format
- Add necessary frontmatter metadata
- Create sidebars configuration
- Ensure proper internal linking between documents

### Task 10: Validation and Review
- Test all code examples for accuracy
- Verify configuration options against codebase
- Check all internal and external links
- Ensure consistency in terminology and style

## Technical Requirements

- All documentation must be in Markdown format
- Code blocks must include proper syntax highlighting
- Diagrams should use Mermaid or similar text-based format
- All file paths and commands must be tested and accurate
- Documentation must match current main branch functionality

## Deliverables

1. Complete set of markdown documentation files
2. Docusaurus configuration files (sidebars.js, etc.)
3. Documentation validation checklist
4. Migration guide from current docs to new structure
