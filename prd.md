# Product Requirements Document: Infrastructure Investigation

## Objectives
Conduct a comprehensive investigation into infrastructure anomalies affecting our AWS deployment, specifically addressing unexpected changes in RDS passwords, ECS task definition reversions, and S3 bucket lifecycle triggers. The investigation will identify root causes and provide actionable solutions to prevent future occurrences.

## Personas
- **DevOps Engineer**: Responsible for maintaining infrastructure stability and implementing fixes
- **Platform Engineer**: Needs reliable infrastructure for deploying ML models and services
- **Security Team**: Concerned about unauthorized password changes and access control
- **Data Team**: Relies on consistent S3 bucket behavior for data pipeline operations

## Success Criteria
1. Root cause identified for RDS password changes with preventive measures implemented
2. ECS task definition version control stabilized with clear deployment process
3. S3 bucket lifecycle policies reviewed and optimized for intended use cases
4. Documentation created for troubleshooting similar issues in the future
5. Monitoring alerts configured to detect anomalies before they impact production

## Tasks

### 1. RDS Password Investigation
- Review AWS CloudTrail logs for RDS password change events
- Analyze Terraform state files for configuration drift
- Check for automated processes or scripts that might trigger password rotation
- Verify IAM policies and access patterns
- Document password management best practices

### 2. ECS Task Definition Analysis
- Examine deployment history for task definition versions
- Review CI/CD pipeline configurations for deployment processes
- Analyze Terraform apply logs for unintended changes
- Check for manual interventions or rollback procedures
- Establish version pinning strategy

### 3. S3 Bucket Lifecycle Review
- Audit current lifecycle policies across all buckets
- Identify triggers causing unexpected transitions
- Review bucket access patterns and data retention requirements
- Optimize lifecycle rules for cost and performance
- Document lifecycle policy standards

### 4. Infrastructure Monitoring Setup
- Configure CloudWatch alarms for infrastructure changes
- Set up AWS Config rules for compliance monitoring
- Implement notification system for critical changes
- Create runbooks for common infrastructure issues
- Establish regular infrastructure review process

### 5. Documentation and Knowledge Transfer
- Create comprehensive investigation report
- Document standard operating procedures
- Update infrastructure as code with comments
- Conduct team knowledge sharing session
- Establish infrastructure change review process
