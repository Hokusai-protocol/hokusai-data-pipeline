# Product Requirements Document: Local Performance Preview

## Objectives

Build a local performance preview tool that enables contributors to estimate the performance impact of their data contributions before submitting to the Hokusai pipeline. This tool will allow contributors to:

1. Fine-tune a model locally using their contributed data
2. Generate a non-binding estimate of the DeltaOne score
3. Save and print structured evaluation results in a format compatible with the main pipeline

## User Personas

### Primary Persona: Data Contributor
- **Background**: Machine learning engineer or data scientist contributing datasets to improve model performance
- **Goals**: Understand the potential impact of their data contribution before submission
- **Pain Points**: Uncertainty about data quality and contribution value
- **Technical Level**: Comfortable with command-line tools and Python environments

### Secondary Persona: Model Evaluator
- **Background**: Technical reviewer validating contributed data quality
- **Goals**: Quickly assess if contributed data meets quality thresholds
- **Pain Points**: Need to run full pipeline to evaluate small contributions
- **Technical Level**: Advanced understanding of ML pipelines and evaluation metrics

## Success Criteria

1. **Performance**: Preview runs complete in under 5 minutes for datasets up to 10,000 samples
2. **Accuracy**: Estimated DeltaOne scores within Â±20% of full pipeline results
3. **Usability**: Single command execution with clear output formatting
4. **Compatibility**: Output format matches main pipeline JSON schema for easy comparison
5. **Resource Efficiency**: Runs on a single machine with 8GB RAM without GPU requirements

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Create Local Model Fine-tuning Module
- Implement a lightweight fine-tuning process that works with contributed data
- Use the same model architecture as the main pipeline but with reduced training epochs
- Support CSV, JSON, and Parquet input formats
- Implement stratified sampling for datasets larger than 10,000 samples
- Include progress indicators during training

### Task 2: Implement Delta Estimation Logic
- Create a simplified version of the DeltaOne calculation
- Load a pre-trained baseline model (or mock baseline in test mode)
- Calculate performance metrics on a held-out validation set
- Compute estimated delta between baseline and fine-tuned model
- Mark results clearly as "PREVIEW - NON-BINDING ESTIMATE"

### Task 3: Design Structured Output Format
- Match the JSON schema from the main pipeline's delta output
- Include preview-specific metadata fields:
  - `preview_mode: true`
  - `estimation_confidence` score
  - `sample_size_used`
  - `time_elapsed`
- Support both console pretty-printing and file export options

### Task 4: Build CLI Interface
- Create a command-line tool `hokusai-preview` with clear arguments:
  - `--data-path`: Path to contributed data file
  - `--output-format`: json|pretty (default: pretty)
  - `--output-file`: Optional file path for saving results
  - `--sample-size`: Maximum samples to use (default: 10000)
  - `--baseline-model`: Path to baseline model (optional, uses default)
- Include helpful error messages and validation

### Task 5: Add Performance Optimizations
- Implement data caching to avoid reprocessing
- Use lightweight model checkpointing
- Optimize memory usage for large datasets
- Add early stopping if convergence is detected

### Task 6: Create Documentation and Examples
- Write comprehensive README for the preview tool
- Include example commands and expected outputs
- Document limitations and accuracy expectations
- Provide troubleshooting guide for common issues

### Task 7: Implement Test Suite
- Unit tests for each module component
- Integration tests with sample datasets
- Performance benchmarks to ensure <5 minute execution
- Accuracy tests comparing preview vs full pipeline results
- Edge case handling (empty data, malformed files, etc.)

## Technical Constraints

1. Must work offline without external API dependencies
2. Should not require GPU acceleration
3. Compatible with Python 3.8+
4. Minimal additional dependencies beyond main pipeline requirements
5. Results must include clear disclaimers about non-binding nature

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

- Web-based UI for preview results
- Real-time preview during data upload
- Multi-model comparison in single preview
- Integration with cloud-based model registry
