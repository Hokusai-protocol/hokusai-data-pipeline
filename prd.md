# Product Requirements Document: Load Baseline Model Step

## Objective

Implement a robust `load_baseline_model` step in the Hokusai evaluation pipeline that loads model versions from registry or artifact store. This step serves as the foundation for model comparison and evaluation by providing a reliable baseline model reference.

## Personas

**Primary Users:**
- Pipeline Engineers: Need to load baseline models for comparison workflows
- ML Engineers: Require access to previous model versions for evaluation
- Data Scientists: Use baseline models for A/B testing and performance benchmarking

**Secondary Users:**
- DevOps Engineers: Monitor pipeline reliability and model loading performance
- Quality Assurance: Validate model loading functionality across environments

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- Successfully load models from MLFlow model registry
- Support loading models from local disk storage
- Validate model compatibility with evaluation metrics
- Handle multiple model formats (pickle, joblib, MLFlow native)
- Provide clear error handling for missing or corrupted models
- Pass loaded model downstream to subsequent pipeline steps

### Performance Requirements
- Model loading completes within 60 seconds for models up to 1GB
- Memory usage remains below 4GB during model loading
- Support concurrent model loading (up to 3 models simultaneously)

### Reliability Requirements
- 99.9% success rate for valid model loading requests
- Graceful handling of network timeouts and storage failures
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting and monitoring

## Technical Specifications

### Core Functionality
1. **MLFlow Integration**: Load models from MLFlow model registry using model name and version
2. **Local Storage Support**: Load models from local file system paths
3. **Model Validation**: Verify model compatibility and required attributes
4. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with detailed error messages
5. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging

### Input Parameters
- `model_source`: Source type (mlflow_registry, local_path)
- `model_identifier`: Model name/version for MLFlow or file path for local
- `validation_config`: Optional validation parameters

### Output
- Loaded model object ready for downstream processing
- Model metadata (version, creation date, metrics)
- Validation status and any warnings

## Implementation Tasks

### Core Development
1. Create `baseline_loader.py` module with `load_baseline_model` function
2. Implement MLFlow model registry integration
3. Add local file system model loading capability
4. Build model validation framework
5. Implement comprehensive error handling
6. Add structured logging throughout the module

### Testing
1. Create unit tests for model loading from MLFlow registry
2. Add unit tests for local file system loading
3. Implement integration tests with mock MLFlow server
4. Create tests for error scenarios (missing models, network failures)
5. Add performance tests for large model loading

### Documentation
1. Update module docstrings with usage examples
2. Add inline comments for complex logic
3. Document configuration parameters and error codes

### Integration
1. Integrate with existing Metaflow pipeline structure
2. Ensure compatibility with MLFlow tracking setup
3. Add proper logging integration with pipeline monitoring

## Dependencies

- MLFlow Python client library
- Metaflow framework
- Python logging module
- File system access for local model storage
- Network access for MLFlow registry communication

## Risk Mitigation

- **Large Model Loading**: Implement streaming/chunked loading for large models
- **Network Failures**: Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Storage Corruption**: Implement model integrity verification
- **Version Conflicts**: Clear error messages for incompatible model versions
