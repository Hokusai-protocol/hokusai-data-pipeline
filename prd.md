# Product Requirements Document: MLFlow Tracking Integration

## Objectives

Integrate MLFlow experiment tracking throughout the Hokusai evaluation pipeline to enable comprehensive monitoring, reproducibility, and analysis of all pipeline stages. This will provide visibility into model training, evaluation metrics, and pipeline execution for both internal teams and external contributors.

## Personas

**Primary User: Data Scientists and ML Engineers**
- Need to track experiments and compare model performance
- Require reproducible results and audit trails
- Want to analyze training metrics and model artifacts

**Secondary User: Pipeline Operators**
- Need to monitor pipeline execution and debug failures
- Require visibility into resource usage and performance
- Want to track pipeline runs and their outcomes

## Success Criteria

- All pipeline steps automatically log to MLFlow
- Model artifacts, metrics, and parameters are tracked consistently
- Pipeline runs can be reproduced from MLFlow metadata
- Experiment comparison and analysis is enabled through MLFlow UI
- Zero manual intervention required for basic tracking

## Tasks

### Core MLFlow Setup
- Configure MLFlow tracking server connection
- Establish experiment naming conventions
- Create base MLFlow utility functions
- Set up artifact storage backend

### Pipeline Integration
- Integrate tracking into load_baseline_model step
- Add tracking to integrate_contributed_data step
- Implement tracking in train_new_model step
- Add tracking to evaluate_on_benchmark step
- Integrate tracking into compare_and_output_delta step

### Metadata and Artifacts
- Define standard parameter logging format
- Implement model artifact storage
- Set up dataset versioning and tracking
- Create pipeline run metadata schema

### Testing and Validation
- Create unit tests for MLFlow utilities
- Add integration tests for pipeline tracking
- Implement mock MLFlow server for testing
- Validate tracking data consistency
