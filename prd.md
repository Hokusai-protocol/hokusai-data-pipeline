# Product Requirements Document

## ETH Address Support in Schema Output Example

### Objectives

Update the valid output example in the schema directory to include ETH wallet addresses. The pipeline already has ETH address support implemented, but the example file needs to be updated to demonstrate this capability. Documentation should also be reviewed to ensure it accurately reflects the ETH address feature.

### Success Criteria

1. Valid output example in schema directory includes ETH wallet address fields
2. Example demonstrates both single and multiple contributor scenarios  
3. Documentation accurately describes ETH address format requirements
4. Schema validation passes with the updated example

### User Personas

**Pipeline Developers**: Need clear examples showing how ETH addresses appear in pipeline outputs to understand the expected format.

**Integration Engineers**: Require accurate schema examples to build downstream systems that consume pipeline outputs.

**Documentation Users**: Need up-to-date examples and documentation that reflect current pipeline capabilities.

### Technical Requirements

#### Schema Example Updates

The valid output example should include:

For single contributor scenarios:
- contributor_info object with wallet_address field
- Valid example ETH address (0x + 40 hex characters)

For multiple contributor scenarios:
- contributors array with each contributor having wallet_address
- Proper weight distribution examples

#### Documentation Review

Review and update as needed:
- Schema documentation explaining ETH address fields
- Any integration guides referencing output format
- Validation requirements for ETH addresses

### Implementation Tasks

1. **Locate Schema Files**: Find the valid output example file in the schema directory
2. **Update Single Contributor Example**: Add wallet_address to contributor_info section
3. **Update Multiple Contributor Example**: Add wallet_address to each contributor in array
4. **Validate Updated Schema**: Run validation to ensure examples are correct
5. **Review Documentation**: Check and update docs referencing the output schema
