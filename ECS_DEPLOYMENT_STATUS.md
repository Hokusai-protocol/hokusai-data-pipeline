# ECS Deployment Status Report

## Summary
Both API and MLflow services have been successfully deployed to ECS with AMD64-compatible Docker images. However, ALB health checks are failing, preventing the services from being accessible.

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
1. **Docker Images Built**: Both API and MLflow images rebuilt for linux/amd64 architecture
2. **Images Pushed to ECR**: Successfully pushed to ECR repositories
3. **ECS Services Running**: Both services have running tasks
4. **API Container Healthy**: API is starting successfully and responding to health checks
5. **Security Groups Updated**: Added rules to allow ALB traffic on port 8001
6. **Routing Rules Configured**: ALB has proper path-based routing rules

### ❌ Issues
1. **ALB Health Checks Failing**: Target health checks timing out despite API responding with 200 OK
2. **Targets Unhealthy**: All targets in "unhealthy" or "initial" state
3. **Service Cycling**: ECS continuously restarting tasks due to failed health checks

## Diagnostics Performed

### Container Status
- API logs show successful startup: `Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8001`
- Health endpoint responding: Multiple `GET /health HTTP/1.1" 200 OK` entries
- Container health checks passing locally (127.0.0.1)
- Some ALB health checks received (10.0.x.x IPs)

### Network Configuration
- Security Group: sg-0864e6f6aee2a5cf4 allows traffic from ALB on port 8001
- Target Group: Configured for HTTP health checks on /health endpoint
- VPC/Subnets: Using default network ACLs (allowing all traffic)

### ALB Configuration
- Main ALB: hokusai-main-development-88510464.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
- Listener Rules:
  - `/api*` → hokusai-api-tg-development (port 8001)
  - `/mlflow*` → hokusai-mlflow-tg-development

## Root Cause Analysis

The most likely causes for the health check failures:

1. **Network Path Issue**: Despite security group rules, there may be a connectivity issue between ALB and containers
2. **Timing Issue**: Health checks may be timing out before the API fully initializes
3. **DNS/Service Discovery**: Internal routing within the VPC may have issues

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Check CloudWatch logs for ALB access logs
   - Verify ENI attachment and routing tables
   - Test connectivity from an EC2 instance in the same VPC

2. **Potential Solutions**:
   - Increase health check grace period in ECS service
   - Add explicit egress rules to security groups
   - Check if container needs more startup time

3. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - Use Application Load Balancer access logs to debug
   - Deploy a test container with network debugging tools
   - Consider using ECS Service Connect for simplified networking

## Commands for Further Investigation

```bash
# Check ALB access logs (if enabled)
aws s3 ls s3://your-alb-logs-bucket/AWSLogs/932100697590/elasticloadbalancing/us-east-1/

# Test from EC2 instance in same VPC
curl -v http://10.0.x.x:8001/health

# Check ECS service events
aws ecs describe-services --cluster hokusai-development --services hokusai-api-development --query 'services[0].events[0:5]'

# Enable ECS Exec for debugging
aws ecs update-service --cluster hokusai-development --service hokusai-api-development --enable-execute-command
```

## Conclusion

The infrastructure is correctly configured and containers are running, but there's a network connectivity issue preventing successful health checks. This requires further investigation at the VPC/networking level.
