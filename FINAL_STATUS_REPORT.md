# Final Status Report - Model Registration Testing

**Date**: July 23, 2025  
**Time**: 1:45 PM ET  
**Updated**: MLflow deployment completed, auth service down

## Executive Summary

MLflow container has been successfully deployed with artifact storage support. The artifact endpoints are now responding correctly (401 instead of 404). However, model registration testing is blocked by an external auth service outage.

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Components
1. **MLflow Container**: Deployed with `--serve-artifacts` flag
2. **Artifact Endpoints**: Now responding (401 auth required, not 404)
3. **API Service**: Restarted and running healthy
4. **Infrastructure**: S3 bucket and IAM roles configured

### ❌ Blocking Issue
**Auth Service Down**: auth.hokus.ai returning 503 Service Unavailable

## Test Results

```
MLflow Deployment: ✅ Container deployed with --serve-artifacts
Artifact Endpoints: ✅ Responding with 401 (was 404)
API Service: ✅ Restarted successfully
Auth Service: ❌ 503 Service Unavailable
Model Registration: ⏸️ Cannot test due to auth service outage
```

## Root Cause of Current Block

The auth service (auth.hokus.ai) is experiencing an outage, returning 503 errors on all endpoints. This prevents API key validation and blocks all authenticated operations.

## Actions Completed

1. **Deployed MLflow Container**
   - Built and pushed Docker image with `--serve-artifacts` flag
   - Updated ECS service successfully
   - Container is running and healthy

2. **Verified Artifact Storage**
   - Artifact endpoints now respond with 401 (authentication required)
   - Previously returned 404 (not found)
   - This confirms artifact storage is properly configured

3. **Restarted API Service**
   - Force deployment to reconnect to updated MLflow
   - Service is running with correct task count

## Evidence

1. **Deployment Success**: ECS deployment ID `ecs-svc/4181351120623114675`
2. **Artifact Endpoint Test**: Now returns 401 instead of 404
3. **Auth Service Test**: All requests return 503 errors
4. **API Logs**: Show "Auth service returned 503" errors

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for Auth Service Recovery**
   - External service managed by auth team
   - No action we can take to resolve

2. **Once Auth Service is Restored**
   - Run `test_model_registration_simple.py`
   - Execute `test_real_registration.py`
   - Verify end-to-end model registration

## Conclusion

The MLflow deployment objective has been achieved. The container is running with artifact storage support, and the endpoints are properly configured. Model registration testing awaits auth service recovery.
