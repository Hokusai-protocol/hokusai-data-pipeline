# Registry Service Critical Fixes Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the critical fixes implemented to address the Hokusai registry service degradation issue that was causing 503 errors.

## Problem Statement

The registry service was experiencing degradation issues with:
- MLflow connectivity failures causing cascade failures
- Health checks returning 503 errors inappropriately
- No automated recovery mechanisms
- Limited diagnostic capabilities
- Poor visibility into service state

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Health Check Implementation ✅

**File**: `src/api/routes/health.py`

**Improvements**:
- **Graceful Circuit Breaker Handling**: Health checks now properly handle circuit breaker states (OPEN, HALF_OPEN, CLOSED) without failing
- **Service State Differentiation**: Distinguishes between `healthy`, `degraded`, `recovering`, and `unhealthy` states
- **Improved Readiness Logic**: Readiness endpoint now uses `can_serve_traffic` logic - returns 503 only when critical services (database) are down
- **Enhanced Status Reporting**: More detailed status information with specific degradation reasons

**New Endpoints**:
- `POST /health/mlflow/reset` - Manual circuit breaker reset
- `GET /health/status` - Comprehensive service status
- Enhanced `/ready` endpoint with graceful degradation

**Key Changes**:
```python
# Before: Simple binary health check
if mlflow_connected:
    status = "healthy"
else:
    status = "unhealthy"  # Would cause 503

# After: Graceful degradation
if circuit_breaker_open:
    status = "degraded"  # Service still available
    can_serve_traffic = True  # Core functionality works
```

### 2. Circuit Breaker Improvements ✅

**File**: `src/utils/mlflow_config.py`

**Enhancements**:
- **Auto-Reset Logic**: Automatically attempts recovery after configurable timeout (default: 30s)
- **Multi-Attempt Recovery**: Tries recovery multiple times with exponential backoff
- **Enhanced State Tracking**: Tracks consecutive successes, recovery attempts, and detailed timing
- **Configurable Parameters**: Environment variable configuration for thresholds and timeouts
- **Manual Reset Capability**: API endpoint for manual circuit breaker reset

**Configuration Options**:
```bash
MLFLOW_CB_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=3      # Failures before opening (default: 3)
MLFLOW_CB_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT=30      # Seconds before retry (default: 30)
MLFLOW_CB_MAX_RECOVERY_ATTEMPTS=3  # Max recovery attempts (default: 3)
```

**State Machine**:
```
CLOSED (normal) → OPEN (failures) → HALF_OPEN (testing) → CLOSED (recovered)
                                  ↘ OPEN (failed recovery)
```

### 3. Comprehensive Diagnostic Script ✅

**File**: `scripts/diagnose_service_health.py`

**Features**:
- **Multi-Component Checking**: API, MLflow, Database, Redis, AWS infrastructure
- **Circuit Breaker Analysis**: Detailed circuit breaker state and metrics
- **AWS Integration**: Checks ECS services, ALB health, RDS status
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, connection health, target group status
- **Structured Output**: JSON output for automation, human-readable summary

**Usage**:
```bash
./scripts/diagnose_service_health.py --api-url https://data.hokus.ai --verbose
```

**Exit Codes**:
- `0`: Service healthy
- `1`: Service degraded/warnings
- `2`: Service critical/unhealthy

### 4. Automated Recovery Script ✅

**File**: `scripts/recover_service.py`

**Recovery Actions**:
1. **Circuit Breaker Reset**: Attempts to reset MLflow circuit breaker
2. **ECS Service Restart**: Forces new deployment of unhealthy ECS services
3. **ALB Target Verification**: Checks and reports on load balancer target health
4. **Service Stabilization**: Waits for services to stabilize with health monitoring
5. **Recovery Verification**: Confirms service restoration

**Safety Features**:
- **Dry Run Mode**: Shows what would be done without making changes
- **Recovery Logging**: Detailed logs of all recovery actions
- **Rollback Safety**: Only performs safe recovery operations
- **AWS Integration**: Works with ECS services and ALB configurations

**Usage**:
```bash
# See what would be done
./scripts/recover_service.py --dry-run

# Perform actual recovery
./scripts/recover_service.py --output recovery.log
```

### 5. Enhanced Testing Framework ✅

**File**: `scripts/test_enhanced_health_checks.py`

**Test Coverage**:
- Basic and detailed health check responses
- Readiness check graceful degradation
- MLflow-specific health endpoints
- Circuit breaker status reporting
- Service metrics availability
- Graceful degradation behavior validation

## Configuration Enhancements ✅

**File**: `src/api/utils/config.py`

Added circuit breaker configuration:
```python
# Circuit Breaker Configuration
mlflow_cb_failure_threshold: int = 3
mlflow_cb_recovery_timeout: int = 30
mlflow_cb_max_recovery_attempts: int = 3
```

## Key Behavioral Changes

### Before the Fixes:
```
MLflow Down → Health Check Fails → 503 Service Unavailable → Complete Service Outage
```

### After the Fixes:
```
MLflow Down → Circuit Breaker Opens → Service Degraded → Core Functionality Still Available
                ↓
            Auto-Recovery Attempts → Service Restored
```

## Service States and HTTP Responses

| Service State | Health Endpoint | Ready Endpoint | Behavior |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| **Healthy** | 200 - `"healthy"` | 200 - `ready: true` | Full functionality |
| **Degraded** | 200 - `"degraded"` | 200 - `ready: false, degraded_mode: true` | Core API works, MLflow features disabled |
| **Recovering** | 200 - `"degraded"` | 200 - `ready: false, recovering: true` | Testing recovery |
| **Unhealthy** | 200 - `"unhealthy"` | 503 - `can_serve_traffic: false` | Critical services down |

## Recovery Scenarios

### Automatic Recovery:
1. **MLflow Timeout**: Circuit breaker opens → waits 30s → tries recovery → closes on success
2. **Intermittent Failures**: Tracks consecutive successes, requires 2 successes to fully recover
3. **Extended Outages**: Uses exponential backoff for extended failures

### Manual Recovery:
1. **API Reset**: `POST /health/mlflow/reset` to manually reset circuit breaker
2. **Script Recovery**: `./scripts/recover_service.py` for comprehensive recovery
3. **Infrastructure Recovery**: ECS service restarts, ALB target health checks

## Monitoring and Alerting

### New Metrics:
- Circuit breaker state and transitions
- Recovery attempt success/failure rates
- Service degradation duration
- Response time degradation

### Endpoints for Monitoring:
- `GET /health/status` - Comprehensive status for monitoring systems
- `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics including circuit breaker state
- `GET /health/mlflow` - Detailed MLflow connectivity status

## Testing and Validation

### Scripts Available:
1. `./scripts/diagnose_service_health.py` - Comprehensive diagnostic
2. `./scripts/recover_service.py` - Automated recovery
3. `./scripts/test_enhanced_health_checks.py` - Functionality validation

### Validation Checklist:
- [x] Circuit breaker opens on failures
- [x] Service stays available during MLflow outage
- [x] Auto-recovery works after timeout
- [x] Manual reset functionality works
- [x] Health checks provide detailed status
- [x] Readiness checks implement graceful degradation
- [x] Diagnostic script identifies issues

## Impact

- **Reduced false alarms**: Health checks no longer fail for MLflow circuit breaker states
- **Improved availability**: Service stays available during MLflow outages
- **Faster recovery**: Automated recovery reduces manual intervention
- **Better observability**: Detailed diagnostics and status reporting
- **Operational efficiency**: Scripts reduce time to diagnose and fix issues

The registry service is now much more resilient and provides better operational visibility, addressing the core 503 error issues while maintaining service availability during infrastructure problems.
