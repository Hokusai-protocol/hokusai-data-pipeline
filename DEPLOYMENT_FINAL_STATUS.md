# Final Deployment Status Report

**Time**: 12+ hours since initial deployment
**Date**: August 14, 2025

## Summary

After extensive troubleshooting and multiple interventions, the services are **partially operational** but still experiencing issues.

## What We Accomplished

### ✅ Successfully Deployed
1. **Redis Resilience Fixes** - Circuit breaker, fallback publisher, and timeout protection
2. **Direct IP Workaround** - Replaced service discovery DNS with direct IP (10.0.1.88:5000)
3. **SSM Parameters Created** - Added missing Redis configuration parameters
4. **Service Updates Initiated** - Forced redeployment with latest code

### ⚠️ Current Status

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **ECS Services** | ✅ Running | All 3 services have tasks running |
| **Auth Service** | ✅ Healthy | Fully operational at auth.hokus.ai |
| **MLflow UI** | ✅ Accessible | Web interface at registry.hokus.ai/mlflow |
| **API Health** | ❌ 404 Not Found | Health endpoint not accessible |
| **Registry API** | ❌ Timeout | API endpoints timing out |
| **Target Groups** | ⚠️ Mixed | ~43% healthy (3/7 targets) |
| **Redis** | ⚠️ Degraded | Using fallback publisher |

## Problems Encountered

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline Issue
- **Problem**: Deployment workflow looking for wrong service names
- **Impact**: Code deployed but services not updated
- **Resolution**: Manual service update required

### 2. SSM Parameter Missing
- **Problem**: Task definitions reference non-existent SSM parameters
- **Impact**: New tasks failed to start with `ResourceInitializationError`
- **Resolution**: Created SSM parameters manually

### 3. Service Discovery Broken
- **Problem**: API service has no service registry configuration
- **Impact**: Cannot resolve internal DNS names
- **Resolution**: Implemented direct IP workaround

### 4. Health Check Configuration
- **Problem**: ALB routing to wrong endpoints or timing out
- **Impact**: Services marked unhealthy despite running
- **Status**: Still unresolved

## Technical Details

### Deployment Versions
- **API Task Definition**: Revision 96 (deploying from 93)
- **MLflow Task Definition**: Revision 23 (deployed)
- **Auth Service**: Stable and operational

### Code Changes Applied
- Redis configuration no longer falls back to localhost
- Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures
- MLflow client uses direct IP (10.0.1.88:5000)
- Health checks have timeout protection

### Infrastructure Fixes Applied
- Created `/hokusai/development/redis/endpoint` SSM parameter
- Created `/hokusai/development/redis/port` SSM parameter
- Manual ECS service updates triggered

## Root Causes

1. **Split Infrastructure Management** - Terraform state conflicts between repos
2. **Service Discovery Misconfiguration** - Services recreated without proper registration
3. **CI/CD Pipeline Bugs** - Service names don't match deployment script
4. **Missing Infrastructure Components** - SSM parameters, service discovery registration

## Recommendations for Full Resolution

### Immediate (Within 24 Hours)
1. **Fix CI/CD Pipeline**
   ```yaml
   # Update .github/workflows/deploy.yml
   # Change service names from 'hokusai-api' to 'hokusai-api-development'
   ```

2. **Fix ALB Routing**
   - Verify listener rules point to correct target groups
   - Ensure health check paths are correct

### Short Term (Within 1 Week)
1. **Consolidate Infrastructure**
   - Move ALL infrastructure to centralized repo
   - Import existing resources to Terraform state
   - Ensure service discovery is properly configured

2. **Fix Service Discovery**
   - Register API service with service discovery
   - Update task definitions to use service discovery DNS

### Long Term (Within 2 Weeks)
1. **Implement Proper Monitoring**
   - Set up CloudWatch dashboards
   - Configure alerts for service health
   - Track deployment success metrics

2. **Improve Deployment Process**
   - Add deployment verification steps
   - Implement rollback automation
   - Add integration tests post-deployment

## Current Workarounds in Place

1. **Direct IP for MLflow** - Bypasses service discovery issues
2. **Redis Fallback Publisher** - Continues operation without Redis
3. **Manual SSM Parameters** - Provides required configuration

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Check service health (currently returns 404)
curl https://registry.hokus.ai/health

# Check auth service (working)
curl https://auth.hokus.ai/health

# Check MLflow UI (working)
curl https://registry.hokus.ai/mlflow

# Check ECS services
aws ecs describe-services \
  --cluster hokusai-development \
  --services hokusai-api-development hokusai-mlflow-development \
  --region us-east-1

# Check target health
aws elbv2 describe-target-health \
  --target-group-arn <target-group-arn> \
  --region us-east-1
```

## Conclusion

After 12+ hours of deployment efforts:
- **Core fixes deployed** but not fully accessible due to infrastructure issues
- **Auth service and MLflow UI working** 
- **API endpoints still experiencing issues** with routing and health checks
- **System is more resilient** but not fully operational

The deployment exposed fundamental infrastructure problems that require coordinated fixes between the application and infrastructure teams. The immediate workarounds provide partial functionality, but comprehensive infrastructure consolidation is needed for full resolution.
