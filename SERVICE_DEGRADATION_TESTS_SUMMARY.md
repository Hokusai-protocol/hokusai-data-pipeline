```bash
python validate_tests.py
```

## Expected Performance Metrics

### Unit Tests
- **100% pass rate** expected
- **< 1 second** execution time per test
- **All edge cases covered**

### Integration Tests  
- **95%+ pass rate** expected
- **< 5 seconds** per test execution
- **Proper degradation behavior validated**

### Load Tests
- **Response times < 2s** under normal load
- **90%+ success rate** under concurrent load (200 requests)
- **80%+ availability** during service degradation

## Integration with CI/CD

The test suite is designed for CI/CD integration:

- **Unit and Integration tests**: Run on every commit
- **Load tests**: Run on major releases or infrastructure changes
- **Chaos tests**: Run periodically or before production deployments

Critical test failures will fail the build, while non-critical failures will generate warnings but allow deployment.

## Maintenance and Updates

The test suite is designed to be maintainable and extensible:

- **Modular design** allows easy addition of new test scenarios
- **Clear documentation** for each test category
- **Consistent patterns** across all test files
- **Mock-based approach** prevents external dependencies in tests

## Conclusion

This comprehensive test suite provides **thorough validation** of the service degradation fixes implemented in the Hokusai data pipeline. With **67 test functions** covering **unit testing**, **integration testing**, **load testing**, and **chaos engineering**, the suite ensures that:

1. **Circuit breakers function correctly** under all conditions
2. **Health endpoints provide accurate information** during normal and degraded states
3. **Services perform adequately** under various load conditions  
4. **System recovers properly** from failure scenarios
5. **Failures are properly isolated** and don't cascade

The tests are **runnable with pytest**, include **proper assertions and documentation**, and provide **comprehensive coverage** of the service degradation functionality.
