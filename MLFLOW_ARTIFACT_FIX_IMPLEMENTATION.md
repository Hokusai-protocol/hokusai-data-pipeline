# MLFlow Artifact Fix Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-07-26  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Artifact Path Translation (`mlflow_proxy_improved.py`)
- **Lines 54-69**: Added proper path translation for artifact endpoints
- Artifact paths now correctly convert from `api/2.0/mlflow-artifacts/` to `ajax-api/2.0/mlflow-artifacts/` for external MLFlow (registry.hokus.ai)
- Internal MLFlow servers keep the standard path unchanged

### 2. HTML to JSON Error Conversion (`mlflow_proxy_improved.py`)
- **Lines 142-154**: Added logic to convert HTML 404 responses to JSON
- When the proxy receives an HTML 404 error, it now returns a proper JSON error response
- This ensures API consistency and prevents confusing HTML error pages in API responses

### 3. Enhanced Health Checks (`mlflow_proxy_improved.py`)
- **Lines 261-289**: Updated artifact health check to actually test the endpoint
- **Line 306**: Added artifact endpoint to detailed health check tests
- **Lines 333-335**: Fixed path translation in detailed health check for both regular and artifact paths

### 4. Comprehensive Unit Tests (`test_mlflow_proxy_improved.py`)
- **Lines 214-236**: Test for artifact path translation with external MLFlow
- **Lines 238-260**: Test for artifact path with internal MLFlow (no translation)
- **Lines 262-288**: Test for HTML 404 to JSON conversion
- **Lines 290-311**: Test that JSON 404 responses are not converted

## Testing Results

All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ Artifact paths translate correctly for external MLFlow
- ✅ Artifact paths remain unchanged for internal MLFlow  
- ✅ HTML 404 errors convert to JSON
- ✅ JSON errors pass through unchanged

## What This Fixes

1. **Third-party artifact uploads**: Users can now successfully upload artifacts through the standard MLFlow client
2. **Consistent API responses**: No more HTML error pages in API responses
3. **Proper routing**: Artifact endpoints now route correctly to the MLFlow server

## Deployment Instructions

1. Deploy the updated `mlflow_proxy_improved.py` file
2. Restart the API service
3. Test artifact endpoints:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
     https://registry.hokus.ai/api/mlflow/api/2.0/mlflow-artifacts/artifacts
   ```

## Verification

After deployment, the following should work:
- Standard MLFlow client artifact operations
- Health checks should show artifact API as "healthy"
- No more HTML 404 errors for artifact endpoints
