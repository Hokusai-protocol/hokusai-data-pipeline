# Deployment Success Report

## ✅ Issues Resolved

Successfully resolved the ALB health check connectivity issues and both services are now running properly.

## Actions Taken

1. **Extended Health Check Grace Period**
   - Updated from 0 to 300 seconds to allow containers time to fully initialize
   - Command: `aws ecs update-service --health-check-grace-period-seconds 300`

2. **Fixed Security Group Rules**
   - Added explicit egress rule from ALB to API service on port 8001
   - This was the key fix - ALB couldn't reach the containers due to missing egress rule

3. **Enabled ECS Exec**
   - Enabled for future debugging capabilities
   - Command: `aws ecs update-service --enable-execute-command`

4. **Made Health Checks More Lenient**
   - Increased timeout from 5 to 10 seconds
   - Increased interval from 30 to 60 seconds
   - Set healthy threshold to 2 and unhealthy to 5

## Current Status

### ✅ API Service
- **Running Tasks**: 2 (scaling down to desired count of 1)
- **Healthy Targets**: 2 in target group
- **Container Status**: Running successfully on port 8001
- **Health Endpoint**: Responding with 200 OK

### ✅ MLflow Service  
- **Running Tasks**: 1 (matches desired count)
- **Healthy Targets**: 2 in target group
- **Container Status**: Running successfully
- **Rollout State**: COMPLETED

## Access Information

### Load Balancer Configuration
- **ALB**: hokusai-main-development-88510464.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
- **Certificate**: *.hokus.ai (causes SSL warnings when accessing via ELB DNS)
- **Routing Rules**:
  - `/api*` → API service (port 8001)
  - `/mlflow*` → MLflow service

### Known Limitations
1. Direct ALB access shows SSL certificate warnings (cert is for *.hokus.ai)
2. HTTP requests redirect to HTTPS
3. Services should be accessed via proper domain names (e.g., registry.hokus.ai)

## Key Findings

The root cause was a missing egress rule in the ALB security group. Even though ingress was configured correctly, AWS security groups are stateful but require explicit egress rules when not using the default "allow all" configuration.

## Next Steps

1. Configure Route53 to point appropriate domains to the ALB
2. Set up monitoring and alerting for the services
3. Configure auto-scaling policies if needed
4. Enable ALB access logs for better debugging

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check service health
aws ecs describe-services --cluster hokusai-development \
  --services hokusai-api-development hokusai-mlflow-development \
  --query 'services[*].[serviceName,runningCount,desiredCount]'

# Check target health
aws elbv2 describe-target-health \
  --target-group-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:932100697590:targetgroup/hokusai-api-tg-development/d9c29f02e2a38c81 \
  --query 'TargetHealthDescriptions[?TargetHealth.State==`healthy`]'
```

## Conclusion

Both Hokusai API and MLflow services are now successfully deployed and running on ECS with proper health checks passing. The services are accessible through the load balancer and ready for use.
