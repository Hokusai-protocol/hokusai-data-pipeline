   c. [x] Test X-API-Key header authentication (Failed - 404)
   d. [x] Document authentication success rates (5.0%)
   e. [x] Identify specific authentication failure patterns (Auth service 502)

## 4. [x] Test Model Registration Workflow
   a. [x] Execute `python tests/test_model_registration_flow.py` with API key
   b. [x] Document results for each of the 6 stages:
      - [x] Stage 1: Local model creation (Success)
      - [x] Stage 2: MLflow experiment creation (Failed - 404)
      - [x] Stage 3: Model run logging (Failed - 404)
      - [x] Stage 4: Model registration (Failed - 404)
      - [x] Stage 5: Model retrieval (Not tested due to earlier failures)
      - [x] Stage 6: Artifact storage (Not tested due to earlier failures)
   c. [x] Collect all error messages and HTTP status codes
   d. [x] Save detailed stack traces for failures

## 5. [x] Run Comprehensive Test Suite
   a. [x] Execute `python tests/run_all_tests.py <API_KEY>`
   b. [x] Monitor test execution progress
   c. [x] Verify all 9 test scripts complete
   d. [x] Check generated output files:
      - [x] test_execution_summary.json
      - [x] INFRASTRUCTURE_ISSUES.md
      - [x] Other test-specific outputs
   e. [x] Validate report generation completed successfully

## 6. [x] Analyze Test Results and Identify Patterns
   a. [x] Review all test outputs for common failure patterns
   b. [x] Categorize issues by infrastructure component:
      - [x] ECS service deployment issues (Services running but misconfigured)
      - [x] ALB routing configuration problems (MLflow routes missing)
      - [x] Target group health check failures (Auth service 502)
      - [x] Authentication service dependencies (Auth service down)
   c. [x] Calculate overall success rates for each component
   d. [x] Identify critical path blockers

## 7. [x] Update MODEL_REGISTRATION_TEST_REPORT.md
   a. [x] Add new test execution timestamp
   b. [x] Update infrastructure health score section
   c. [x] Document current service availability status
   d. [x] Add detailed failure analysis for each component
   e. [x] Include specific recommendations for infrastructure team
   f. [x] Add comparison with previous test results

## 8. [x] Create Infrastructure Issues Documentation
   a. [x] Generate comprehensive INFRASTRUCTURE_ISSUES.md (auto-generated)
   b. [x] For each issue, document:
      - [x] Service name and component
      - [x] Specific error message and HTTP status
      - [x] Expected vs actual behavior
      - [x] Terraform resource references
      - [x] Suggested fix with priority
   c. [x] Organize issues by priority (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   d. [x] Add infrastructure team action items

## 9. [ ] Test Edge Cases and Additional Scenarios
   a. [ ] Test with invalid API key to verify error handling
   b. [ ] Test timeout scenarios for slow responses
   c. [ ] Verify health check endpoint behavior
   d. [ ] Test direct service connectivity if possible
   e. [ ] Document any unexpected behaviors

## 10. [x] Generate Executive Summary
   a. [x] Create high-level summary of testing results
   b. [x] Highlight critical infrastructure blockers
   c. [x] Provide success metrics and scores
   d. [x] List top 5 priority fixes for infrastructure team
   e. [x] Include timeline estimates for fixes

## 11. [ ] Prepare Infrastructure Team Handoff
   a. [x] Compile all test reports into single directory
   b. [ ] Create README with report descriptions
   c. [x] Highlight files infrastructure team should review
   d. [x] Include specific terraform commands if applicable
   e. [ ] Add contact information for questions

## 12. [ ] Documentation
   a. [ ] Update project README with testing status
   b. [x] Document any new issues discovered

   d. [ ] Create runbook for future infrastructure testing

## Testing (Dependent on Infrastructure Fixes)

Note: These tests can only be completed after infrastructure team deploys missing services

13. [ ] Post-Fix Validation Testing
   a. [ ] Re-run infrastructure health check
   b. [ ] Verify all ECS services are running
   c. [ ] Test model registration end-to-end
   d. [ ] Validate artifact storage working
   e. [ ] Confirm infrastructure score >80%

14. [ ] Performance Testing
   a. [ ] Measure API response times
   b. [ ] Test concurrent model registrations
   c. [ ] Validate system under load
   d. [ ] Document performance benchmarks
   e. [ ] Compare with SLA requirements

15. [ ] Integration Testing
   a. [ ] Test with real ML model (not just synthetic)
   b. [ ] Validate model serving capabilities
   c. [ ] Test model versioning workflows
   d. [ ] Verify cross-service communication
   e. [ ] Document integration test results
