# API Endpoint Migration Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Authentication Middleware Updates ✅
**File**: `src/middleware/auth.py`

Updated the `excluded_paths` list to include all health-related endpoints that shouldn't require authentication:
- Added `/ready`, `/live`, `/version`, `/metrics`
- Added `/api/health/mlflow` for MLflow health checks
- All health endpoints now properly bypass authentication

### 2. Endpoint Analysis Completed ✅
**Files Created**:
- `features/migrate-api-endpoints/endpoint-analysis.md` - Comprehensive comparison of current vs documented endpoints
- `features/migrate-api-endpoints/prd.md` - Product requirements document
- `features/migrate-api-endpoints/tasks.md` - Detailed task list

### 3. Tests Created ✅
**Files Created**:
- `tests/test_api_endpoints_migration.py` - Comprehensive endpoint structure tests
- `tests/test_endpoint_simple.py` - Simple authentication exclusion verification

## Key Findings

### Already Correct ✅
- All model endpoints are properly implemented at `/models/*`
- DSPy endpoints correctly use `/api/v1/dspy/*` prefix
- MLflow proxy is properly configured at `/mlflow/*`
- Contributor impact endpoint uses correct parameter name `{address}`
- Model registration endpoint exists at `POST /models/register`
- Model lineage endpoint exists at `POST /models/{model_id}/lineage`

### Fixed Issues ✅
1. **Authentication Exclusions**: Health endpoints (`/ready`, `/live`, `/version`, `/metrics`) were requiring authentication but shouldn't - FIXED

### Remaining Considerations

1. **MLflow Health Endpoint Consolidation**: Multiple implementations exist but all are functional:
   - `/health/mlflow` (in health.py)
   - `/mlflow/health/mlflow` (in mlflow_proxy_improved.py)
   - `/api/health/mlflow` (in health_mlflow.py)
   - These provide different levels of detail and are all useful

2. **Debug Endpoint**: `/debug` exists but is controlled by DEBUG_MODE flag - no action needed

3. **Documentation**: All endpoints match the API_ENDPOINT_REFERENCE.md documentation

## Testing

Tests verify:
- ✅ Health endpoints don't require authentication
- ✅ Model endpoints require authentication
- ✅ DSPy endpoints use correct prefix
- ✅ MLflow proxy is configured
- ✅ Contributor endpoint uses correct parameter
- ✅ Authentication middleware exclusions

## Backward Compatibility

No breaking changes were made. All existing endpoints continue to work as before.

## Deployment Notes

The only change is to the authentication middleware exclusion list, which will take effect immediately upon deployment. No database migrations or infrastructure changes are required.
