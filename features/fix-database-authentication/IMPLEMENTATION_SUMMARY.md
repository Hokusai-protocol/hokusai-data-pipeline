# Database Authentication Fix - Implementation Summary

## âœ… Issue Resolved

The database authentication issue has been successfully resolved. The API service is now connecting to the PostgreSQL database using the correct credentials.

## Problem Summary

The Hokusai API service was failing to authenticate with the PostgreSQL RDS database because:
1. The application was trying to connect as user "postgres" instead of "mlflow"
2. The password in AWS Secrets Manager was base64-encoded and contained invalid characters for PostgreSQL
3. The connection string wasn't properly URL-encoding special characters in passwords

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Code Fixes
- **Removed hardcoded password** from `src/api/utils/config.py`
- **Added AWS Secrets Manager integration** with proper fallback handling
- **Fixed URL encoding** for passwords containing special characters (using `urllib.parse.quote_plus`)
- **Enhanced error handling** with clear logging of credential sources

### 2. Infrastructure Updates
- **Updated RDS password** to a valid format (no special characters that break PostgreSQL)
- **Updated AWS Secrets Manager** with the new password
- **Deployed new Docker image** with the fixes (tag: `fix-db-auth`)

### 3. Key Changes Made

#### src/api/utils/config.py
```python
# Before: Hardcoded password
database_password: str = "postgres"

# After: Required from environment
database_password: Optional[str] = None  # Must come from environment or AWS Secrets Manager

# Added URL encoding for connection strings
from urllib.parse import quote_plus
encoded_password = quote_plus(self.effective_database_password)
```

## Deployment Details

- **Docker Image**: `932100697590.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/hokusai-api:fix-db-auth`
- **ECS Task Definition**: `hokusai-api-development:67`
- **New RDS Password**: Stored in AWS Secrets Manager at `hokusai/app-secrets/development`
- **Environment Variable**: `DB_PASSWORD` injected from Secrets Manager

## Current Status

```json
{
  "postgres": "healthy",
  "mlflow": "healthy",
  "redis": "disabled",
  "message_queue": "unhealthy",
  "external_api": "healthy"
}
```

## Testing

Created `test_database_connection.py` script to verify:
- Environment variable loading
- Configuration processing
- Database connectivity
- Password masking in logs

## Remaining Issues

- **Message Queue**: Still unhealthy due to missing `validate_json_schema` import
- **Redis**: Disabled (not deployed, which is expected)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Password Format**: PostgreSQL passwords cannot contain certain special characters (/, @, ", space)
2. **URL Encoding**: Connection strings must properly encode special characters
3. **Secret Rotation**: When updating RDS passwords, both the database and Secrets Manager must be synchronized
4. **Deployment Time**: ECS deployments with new secrets require task restarts to pick up changes

## Next Steps

1. Fix the message queue import issue (`validate_json_schema`)
2. Add integration tests for database connectivity
3. Document the credential flow in the main README
4. Consider implementing connection pooling for better performance
