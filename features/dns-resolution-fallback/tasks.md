# DNS Resolution Fallback - Implementation Tasks

## Completed Tasks ✅

### Core Implementation
- [x] Review and analyze existing DNS/connection code
- [x] Write unit tests for DNS resolver utility (33 tests)
- [x] Implement DNS resolver utility (`src/utils/dns_resolver.py`)
  - [x] DNS resolution with caching
  - [x] 5-minute cache TTL
  - [x] Fallback to cached IP on failure
  - [x] Environment variable fallback support
  - [x] Concurrent request handling
  - [x] Comprehensive logging

### MLFlow Integration
- [x] Write integration tests for MLFlow configuration (17 tests)
- [x] Update MLFlow configuration to use DNS resolver
  - [x] Integrate into `mlflow_config.py`
  - [x] Add retry logic with exponential backoff
  - [x] Maintain backward compatibility
  - [x] Update `mlflow_dynamic_config.py`

### Health Monitoring
- [x] Write tests for health check DNS monitoring (12 tests)
- [x] Add DNS resolution monitoring to health checks
  - [x] Update `health.py` with DNS status
  - [x] Track resolution success rate
  - [x] Include DNS health in readiness checks

### Service Updates
- [x] Update `config.py` to use DNS resolver
- [x] Update `model_registry.py` for DNS fallback
- [x] Update `health_mlflow.py` for DNS awareness

### Testing
- [x] Run all unit tests (62 tests passing)
- [x] Verify DNS resolution functionality
- [x] Test fallback mechanisms
- [x] Validate health check integration
