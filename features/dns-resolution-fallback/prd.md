# Product Requirements Document: DNS Resolution Fallback and Connection Resilience

## Executive Summary
This feature implements DNS resolution fallback mechanisms and connection resilience for the Hokusai data pipeline service discovery, ensuring service availability during DNS infrastructure issues.

## Problem Statement
The Hokusai data pipeline currently experiences service disruptions when DNS resolution fails for service discovery endpoints (e.g., mlflow.hokusai-development.local). This causes complete service outages and prevents model registration, API calls, and health checks from functioning properly.

## Goals and Objectives
- Implement DNS caching with 5-minute TTL
- Provide fallback to cached IPs during DNS failures
- Support emergency fallback via environment variables
- Achieve 99.9% service availability despite DNS issues
- Add comprehensive DNS health monitoring

## Technical Requirements

### DNS Resolver Utility
- Location: `src/utils/dns_resolver.py`
- Features:
  - DNS resolution with caching (5-minute TTL)
  - Fallback to cached IP on failure
  - Environment variable fallback (MLFLOW_FALLBACK_IP)
  - Concurrent request handling
  - Comprehensive logging and metrics

### MLFlow Integration
- Update `src/utils/mlflow_config.py`
- Integrate DNS resolver for all MLFlow connections
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Maintain backward compatibility

### Health Monitoring
- Update `src/api/routes/health.py`
- Add DNS resolution status to health checks
- Track DNS resolution success rate
- Alert on repeated failures

## Implementation Approach
1. Write comprehensive unit tests (TDD)
2. Implement DNS resolver utility
3. Integrate with MLFlow configuration
4. Add health monitoring
5. Deploy with gradual rollout

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all DNS resolution scenarios
- Integration tests with MLFlow
- Chaos engineering for DNS failure simulation
- Load testing for concurrent requests
- End-to-end validation

## Success Metrics
- DNS resolution success rate > 99.9%
- Zero DNS-related downtime
- Cache hit rate > 90%
- Response time < 10ms overhead

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Cache invalidation issues
  - **Mitigation**: TTL-based expiration with manual override capability
- **Risk**: Configuration complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Sensible defaults with clear documentation
- **Risk**: Performance impact
  - **Mitigation**: Async resolution with request deduplication
