# Product Requirements Document: Fix Database Issues with API Service

## Objectives

Restore full functionality of the Hokusai API service by resolving PostgreSQL connection timeouts, fixing health check failures, and ensuring stable database connectivity. The API service must reliably connect to all required backend services including PostgreSQL, Redis (when deployed), and MLflow to enable model registration and deployment workflows.

## Personas

### Primary Users
- **Data Scientists**: Need reliable API service to register models through MLflow integration
- **DevOps Engineers**: Require stable health checks and monitoring for service maintenance
- **Platform Users**: Depend on consistent API availability for model deployment workflows

### Secondary Users
- **Infrastructure Team**: Need clear diagnostics and monitoring to maintain service health
- **Third-Party Developers**: Require stable API endpoints for integration

## Success Criteria

1. **Database Connectivity**: PostgreSQL connections succeed with < 1% failure rate
2. **Health Check Stability**: API health endpoint returns "healthy" status > 99% uptime
3. **Service Availability**: Zero false-positive unhealthy states from ALB health checks
4. **Circuit Breaker Performance**: MLflow circuit breaker remains closed during normal operations
5. **Response Times**: Database queries complete within 2 seconds under normal load
6. **Graceful Degradation**: Service continues operating when non-critical dependencies fail

## Technical Requirements

### Database Configuration
- Fix PostgreSQL database name mismatch between code and infrastructure
- Implement proper connection pooling with configurable pool size
- Add connection retry logic with exponential backoff
- Increase connection timeouts from 5 to 10 seconds
- Support environment variable configuration for all database parameters

### Health Check Implementation
- Differentiate between liveness and readiness probes
- Implement graceful degradation for non-critical service failures
- Add detailed diagnostic information to health status endpoint
- Configure appropriate timeouts for each backend service check
- Return partial availability status when some services are degraded

### Redis Integration
- Make Redis optional for core API functionality
- Implement fallback mechanisms when Redis is unavailable
- Add Redis deployment to infrastructure or document as optional
- Configure Redis connection with proper timeout handling
- Support message queue operations when Redis is available

### Circuit Breaker Optimization
- Tune failure threshold based on service criticality
- Implement gradual recovery with increasing success requirements
- Add metrics for circuit breaker state transitions
- Configure separate circuit breakers for different services
- Support manual circuit breaker reset for operations

### Infrastructure Updates
- Verify security group rules allow ECS-to-RDS communication
- Ensure network ACLs permit database traffic
- Configure RDS parameter group for optimal performance
- Add CloudWatch alarms for connection metrics
- Implement connection monitoring and alerting

### Phase 3: Redis and Message Queue
11. Make Redis connections optional with fallback logic
12. Add Redis deployment to infrastructure (optional)
13. Implement message queue abstraction layer
14. Add dead letter queue handling
15. Configure Redis connection pooling

### Phase 4: Circuit Breaker and Monitoring
16. Optimize circuit breaker thresholds and timeouts
17. Add metrics collection for circuit breaker states
18. Implement CloudWatch custom metrics
19. Create monitoring dashboard for service health
20. Add alerting for critical service failures

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation
21. Write comprehensive integration tests for database connectivity
22. Add unit tests for health check logic
23. Implement load testing for connection pooling
24. Create chaos testing scenarios for failure recovery
25. Document operational runbooks for common issues
