# Product Requirements Document: Test Model Registration

## Objectives

The primary objective is to comprehensively test the model registration functionality of the hokusai-data-pipeline following the recent infrastructure migration to a centralized repository. This testing will validate that all infrastructure components are properly configured and identify any issues that need to be resolved by the infrastructure team.

## Personas

### Primary User: Third-Party Model Developer
- Uses Hokusai API to register machine learning models
- Requires reliable authentication and model storage
- Expects seamless integration with standard MLflow workflows

### Secondary User: Infrastructure Team
- Needs clear documentation of infrastructure issues
- Requires actionable feedback on configuration problems
- Responsible for fixing identified issues

## Success Criteria

1. **Authentication Validation**: API key authentication works correctly through the new infrastructure
2. **Model Registration**: End-to-end model registration completes successfully
3. **MLflow Integration**: MLflow proxy routes requests correctly to the registry
4. **Error Documentation**: All failures are documented with root causes and recommendations
5. **Infrastructure Verification**: Health endpoints and service connectivity confirmed

## Tasks

### 1. Infrastructure Health Verification
Test basic connectivity and health status of all services involved in model registration:
- Verify ALB routing and health endpoints
- Check ECS service status and task health
- Validate MLflow service availability
- Test Redis connectivity for auth caching

### 2. Authentication Testing
Validate the authentication flow with user-provided API keys:
- Test Bearer token authentication
- Verify X-API-Key header support
- Check auth service integration
- Validate token caching behavior

### 3. Model Registration Flow Testing
Execute complete model registration workflow:
- Create and train a sample model
- Register model with metadata and metrics
- Verify model storage in MLflow
- Test model retrieval and versioning

### 4. MLflow Proxy Verification
Test the MLflow proxy routing functionality:
- Verify experiment creation and tracking
- Test artifact upload and storage
- Validate metric logging
- Check model registry operations

### 5. Error Scenario Testing
Test common failure scenarios and edge cases:
- Invalid API key handling
- Network timeout behavior
- Rate limiting responses
- Malformed request handling

### 6. Documentation Generation
Create comprehensive documentation of findings:
- Working features and successful tests
- Failed tests with error details
- Root cause analysis for failures
- Actionable recommendations for infrastructure team

### 7. Integration Test Suite
Run all existing test scripts in the repository:
- test_model_registration_simple.py
- test_auth_registration.py
- test_correct_registration.py
- verify_model_registration.py
- test_endpoint_availability.py
- scripts/test_mlflow_routing.py
- scripts/test_health_endpoints.py

## Technical Requirements

### Environment Setup
- Valid Hokusai API key provided by user
- Access to production infrastructure (development environment)
- Python environment with required dependencies
- Network connectivity to registry.hokus.ai

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for full workflows
- End-to-end tests simulating third-party usage
- Performance tests for latency and throughput

### Documentation Deliverables
- Test execution report with pass/fail status
- Infrastructure issues report for hokusai-infrastructure team
- Recommendations for configuration improvements
- Updated test documentation and scripts
