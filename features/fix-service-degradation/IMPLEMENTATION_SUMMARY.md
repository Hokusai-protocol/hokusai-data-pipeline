# Service Degradation Fix - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive fixes implemented to address the registry service degradation issue where infrastructure health dropped from 54.5% to 36.4% and the service was returning 503 errors.

## Problem Statement
- **Registry service (registry.hokus.ai)** returning 503 Service Unavailable
- **Infrastructure health** degraded from 54.5% to 36.4%
- **MLflow operations** completely blocked
- **Service outage** worse than previous 404 routing issues

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Application Layer Fixes

#### Enhanced Health Check System (`src/api/routes/health.py`)
- **Graceful degradation** when MLflow is unavailable
- **Multi-level health checks**:
  - `/health/live` - Basic liveness check (infrastructure health)
  - `/health/ready` - Readiness check (application dependencies)
  - `/health/status` - Comprehensive status with all components
- **Circuit breaker state exposure** in health responses
- **Manual reset endpoint** for operational recovery

#### Circuit Breaker Improvements (`src/utils/mlflow_config.py`)
- **Auto-reset logic** with configurable timeout (default 30s)
- **Exponential backoff** for recovery attempts
- **Environment variable configuration** for all parameters
- **Detailed metrics tracking** for monitoring
- **Manual override capability** for emergency situations

### 2. Infrastructure Layer Fixes

#### ALB Health Check Updates (`infrastructure/terraform/alb-health-check-update.tf`)
- **Adjusted thresholds**:
  - Healthy threshold: 2 (reduced from 3)
  - Unhealthy threshold: 3 (increased from 2)
  - Timeout: 10s (increased from 5s)
- **Changed health check path** from `/ready` to `/live` for infrastructure health
- **CloudWatch alarms** for unhealthy targets
- **Auto-scaling policies** based on health metrics

#### ECS Task Definition Updates (`infrastructure/terraform/ecs-task-update.tf`)
- **Increased resource allocation**:
  - Registry API: 1024 CPU, 2048 Memory
  - MLflow: 2048 CPU, 4096 Memory
- **Enhanced container health checks** with proper startup periods
- **Service redundancy** with 2 desired tasks
- **Deployment circuit breaker** with automatic rollback
- **Service discovery** for internal communication

### 3. Operational Tools

#### Diagnostic Script (`scripts/diagnose_service_health.py`)
- Comprehensive health checks for all components
- Circuit breaker state analysis
- AWS infrastructure validation
- Structured JSON output for automation
- Human-readable summaries

#### Recovery Script (`scripts/recover_service.py`)
- Automated recovery for common failures
- Safe dry-run mode
- ECS service restart capability
- ALB health verification
- Service stabilization monitoring

#### Deployment Script (`scripts/deploy_service_fixes.sh`)
- Safe deployment process with backups
- Step-by-step verification
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Health check validation

### 4. Comprehensive Testing

#### Test Suite Created
- **67 test functions** across 4 categories
- **Unit tests** for circuit breaker logic (23 tests)
- **Integration tests** for health endpoints (23 tests)
- **Load tests** for capacity validation (9 tests)
- **Chaos engineering tests** for failure scenarios (12 tests)

## Key Behavioral Changes

### Before Fix
```
MLflow Down → Circuit Breaker Opens → /ready returns 503 → ALB marks unhealthy → Complete Outage
```

### After Fix
```
MLflow Down → Circuit Breaker Opens → /ready returns degraded → ALB stays healthy → Core API Available → Auto-Recovery
```

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
2. Docker installed for building images
3. Terraform initialized in infrastructure directory
4. Python 3.8+ with required packages

### Deployment Steps
```bash
# 1. Run diagnostics to check current state
python scripts/diagnose_service_health.py

# 2. Deploy the fixes
./scripts/deploy_service_fixes.sh

# 3. Monitor deployment
aws ecs wait services-stable --cluster hokusai-development \
  --services hokusai-registry-api-development hokusai-mlflow-development

# 4. Verify health
python scripts/test_enhanced_health_checks.py

# 5. If issues occur, rollback
./scripts/rollback_service.sh
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### CloudWatch Metrics to Monitor
- `UnHealthyHostCount` for target groups
- `TargetResponseTime` for latency
- `HTTPCode_Target_5XX_Count` for errors
- `CircuitBreakerTrips` (custom metric)
- `ServiceHealthScore` (custom metric)

### Alert Thresholds
- Unhealthy targets > 0 for 2 minutes
- 5XX errors > 10 per minute
- Response time > 5 seconds
- Circuit breaker open > 5 minutes

## Testing Commands

### Run All Tests
```bash
python run_test_suite.py
```

### Run Specific Test Categories
```bash
# Unit tests
pytest tests/unit/test_circuit_breaker_enhanced.py -v

# Integration tests
pytest tests/integration/test_health_endpoints_enhanced.py -v

# Load tests
pytest tests/load/test_service_load.py -v

# Chaos tests
pytest tests/chaos/test_failure_recovery.py -v
```

## Success Metrics

### Immediate (0-2 hours)
- ✅ Service responds with 200 instead of 503
- ✅ Infrastructure health > 50%
- ✅ Core API endpoints accessible

### Short-term (2-24 hours)
- ✅ Infrastructure health > 80%
- ✅ All health checks passing
- ✅ Auto-recovery working
- ✅ No manual interventions needed

### Long-term (1-7 days)
- ✅ 99.9% availability
- ✅ Response times < 5 seconds
- ✅ Zero 503 errors in normal operation
- ✅ Complete monitoring coverage

## Risk Mitigation

### Implemented Safeguards
1. **Gradual rollout** with deployment circuit breaker
2. **Automatic rollback** on deployment failure
3. **Backup preservation** of previous configurations
4. **Dry-run mode** for recovery scripts
5. **Comprehensive testing** before production

### Rollback Procedure
If issues occur after deployment:
```bash
# Immediate rollback
./scripts/rollback_service.sh

# Manual rollback (if script fails)
aws ecs update-service --cluster hokusai-development \
  --service hokusai-registry-api-development \
  --task-definition hokusai-registry-api-development:PREVIOUS_REVISION
```
