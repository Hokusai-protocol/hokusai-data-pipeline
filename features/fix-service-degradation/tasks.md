## Critical Path Tasks

**Immediate Priority (Must complete first):**
- Task 1: Immediate Service Diagnostics
- Task 2: Service Restoration Attempt
- Task 4a: Update ALB health check parameters

**Secondary Priority (After service restoration):**
- Task 6: Enhanced Monitoring Setup
- Task 8: Write and Implement Tests
- Task 7: Automated Recovery Mechanisms

**Long-term Priority (Within 7 days):**
- Task 10: Infrastructure Resilience
- Task 11: Documentation and Runbooks

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Infrastructure health score restored to >80%
- [ ] Service availability >99.9% over 24 hours
- [ ] Response times <5 seconds for health checks
- [ ] Zero 503 errors in normal operation
- [ ] Automated recovery working within 2 minutes
- [ ] All tests passing with >90% coverage
- [ ] Complete documentation and runbooks available

## Risk Mitigation

- [ ] Create database backups before changes
- [ ] Implement gradual rollout for configuration changes
- [ ] Maintain rollback plan for each phase
- [ ] Test changes in staging environment first
- [ ] Keep stakeholders informed of progress

## Dependencies
