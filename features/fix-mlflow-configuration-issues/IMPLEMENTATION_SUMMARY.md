# MLflow Configuration Fix - Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-08-05
**Task**: Fix configuration issues with MLFlow service
**Status**: Partially Complete

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. ✅ Fixed ALB Routing Configuration
- **Issue**: MLflow API endpoints were returning 404 errors
- **Root Cause**: ALB listener rule was routing `/api/mlflow/*` directly to MLflow service instead of through API proxy
- **Solution**: Updated ALB listener rule to forward to API service (registry_api target group)
- **Result**: Endpoints now return 401/502 instead of 404 - routing is working

### 2. ✅ Created Platform API Key
- **Created**: New API key with platform access
- **Key**: `hk_live_NVWOYDfNfTJyFzUDkQDBk2LLA4pB5qza`
- **Service**: platform
- **Scopes**: read, write
- **Status**: Successfully created and validated

### 3. ⚠️ Updated Internal MLflow Configuration
- **Issue**: API service was using external URL for MLflow, creating a loop
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  - Added service discovery configuration for internal DNS
  - Updated MLFLOW_SERVER_URL to use internal IP (10.0.1.173:5000)
  - Added security group rules for inter-service communication
- **Current Status**: Services deployed but experiencing connectivity issues

## Current Status

### Working
- ✅ ALB routing rules properly configured
- ✅ MLflow endpoints accessible (return 401/502 instead of 404)
- ✅ New platform API key created
- ✅ Auth service operational

### Issues Remaining
- ⚠️ API service returns 502 Bad Gateway when accessing MLflow
- ⚠️ Internal connectivity between API and MLflow services needs debugging
- ⚠️ Service discovery may not be fully operational

## Files Modified

### Infrastructure (hokusai-infrastructure repo)
1. `/environments/registry-alb-listener-rules.tf` - Fixed routing to use API proxy
2. `/environments/data-pipeline-ecs-services.tf` - Added service discovery and updated MLFLOW_SERVER_URL

### Data Pipeline (this repo)
1. Created test scripts for validation
2. Updated CLAUDE.md with repository structure

## Next Steps

To complete the MLflow configuration:

1. **Debug Internal Connectivity**
   - Verify network connectivity between API and MLflow services
   - Check if MLflow service is accessible on port 5000
   - Review CloudWatch logs for specific connection errors

2. **Alternative Solutions**
   - Consider using AWS App Mesh for service-to-service communication
   - Implement ECS Service Connect for simplified service discovery
   - Use environment-specific MLflow endpoint configuration

3. **Testing**
   - Once connectivity is resolved, run full model registration test
   - Validate all MLflow operations (experiments, runs, models)
   - Test with multiple API keys

## Commands for Verification

```bash
# Check service health
aws elbv2 describe-target-health \
  --target-group-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:932100697590:targetgroup/hokusai-reg-api-development/aab4ed4b619b04c0

# Test MLflow endpoint
curl -H "X-API-Key: hk_live_NVWOYDfNfTJyFzUDkQDBk2LLA4pB5qza" \
  https://registry.hokus.ai/api/mlflow/api/2.0/mlflow/experiments/search

# Check service logs
aws logs tail /ecs/hokusai-api-development --since 5m
```

## Recommendations

1. **Short-term**: Focus on fixing the internal connectivity issue between API and MLflow services
2. **Long-term**: Implement proper service discovery using AWS Cloud Map or ECS Service Connect
3. **Monitoring**: Set up CloudWatch alarms for service health and connectivity issues
