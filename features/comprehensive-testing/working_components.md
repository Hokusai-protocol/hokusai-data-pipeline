# Working Components Documentation

**Date**: 2025-08-06  
**Test Execution**: Comprehensive Infrastructure Testing  
**Environment**: hokusai-development (production)

## ‚úÖ Fully Operational Components

### 1. Authentication Service
- **Status**: ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL
- **Endpoint**: https://auth.hokus.ai
- **Health Check**: Returns 200 OK
- **Response Time**: 120-135ms (healthy)
- **Key Features Working**:
  - Root endpoint (`/`): Returns service info
  - Health endpoint (`/health`): Returns healthy status
  - API documentation (`/docs`): Accessible
  - OpenAPI spec (`/openapi.json`): Available
- **ECS Status**: Running 1/1 tasks

### 2. ECS Services
- **Status**: ‚úÖ ALL RUNNING
- **Services Active**: 3/3
  - hokusai-api-development: Running
  - hokusai-mlflow-development: Running  
  - hokusai-auth-development: Running
- **Task Health**: All tasks showing as running in ECS

### 3. Target Groups (ALB)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ HEALTHY TARGETS
- **API Service Target Group**: 1 healthy target
- **MLflow Service Target Group**: 2 healthy targets
- **Health Checks**: Passing for registered targets

### 4. Local Testing Components
- **Python Environment**: ‚úÖ Working (Python 3.11.8)
- **Test Framework**: ‚úÖ Pytest functional
- **Local Model Creation**: ‚úÖ Can create models locally
- **Dependencies**: ‚úÖ All required packages installed

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Working Components

### 1. Circuit Breaker Logic
- **Unit Tests**: 17/23 passing (73.9% success rate)
- **Core Functionality**: Working
- **Issues**: Edge cases failing (zero threshold, zero timeout)
- **Recovery Logic**: Functional but with some test failures

### 2. Redis Service
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è HEALTHY but not integrated
- **Local Connection**: Working when available
- **Issue**: Not deployed in production environment
- **Impact**: Optional component, not blocking core functionality

## üîÑ Components with Intermittent Issues

### 1. HTTPS Redirect
- **HTTP to HTTPS**: Automatic redirect working
- **SSL Certificates**: Valid for *.hokus.ai domains
- **Issue**: Some HTTP endpoints show SSL errors due to redirect handling

### 2. API Key Validation
- **Auth Headers**: Recognized by system
- **Issue**: Cannot fully validate due to backend service issues
- **Partial Success**: API key format accepted, backend validation failing

## üìä Performance Metrics (Where Available)

### Response Times
- Auth Service Health: 120-135ms ‚úÖ
- Direct Auth Endpoints: 200-400ms ‚úÖ
- API Gateway (when accessible): 500ms-2s ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Availability Metrics
- Auth Service Uptime: 100% during testing
- ECS Task Stability: No restarts observed
- Target Group Health: Stable during test period

## üõ†Ô∏è Infrastructure Components

### AWS Resources (Confirmed Running)
- **ECS Cluster**: hokusai-development
- **Application Load Balancers**: Active
- **Route 53 DNS**: Resolving correctly
  - registry.hokus.ai ‚Üí ALB
  - auth.hokus.ai ‚Üí ALB
- **VPC and Networking**: Functional

## üìù Testing Infrastructure

### Successful Test Execution
- Service health diagnostics script: ‚úÖ
- Authentication endpoint discovery: ‚úÖ
- Target group health checks: ‚úÖ
- Python test environment: ‚úÖ

### Test Data
- Can generate test models locally
- Can create mock data for testing
- Test API key provided and recognized

## üîç Monitoring and Observability

### Available Endpoints
- `/health` on auth service
- `/docs` for API documentation
- `/openapi.json` for API specification

### Logging
- CloudWatch logs configured for services
- ECS task logs available
- Application logs being generated

## Summary

**Total Working Components**: 15+  
**Partial/Intermittent**: 4  
**Critical Services Running**: Auth Service, ECS Tasks, ALBs  

While core infrastructure components are running, the integration between services is where most issues occur. The authentication service stands out as the most stable component, maintaining 100% availability during testing.
