# Deployment Investigation - Test Result Discrepancy

**Date**: 2025-08-06  
**Investigation**: Why comprehensive tests showed database failures after fix was merged

## Executive Summary

The comprehensive tests showed database failures because **the fixes were not deployed to production**. The database authentication fix (PR #70) was merged at 5:12 PM, but the ECS service was last deployed at 4:34 PM with the old configuration.

## Timeline Analysis

| Time | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| 4:29 PM | AWS Secret updated with new password | Password ready |
| 4:34 PM | ECS service deployed (task def :67) | Running old code |
| 5:12 PM | PR #70 merged (database fixes) | Fix in main branch |
| 5:37 PM | Comprehensive tests started | Testing old code |
| 5:45 PM | Tests completed showing failures | Expected - fix not deployed |

## Root Cause

**The database fixes exist in the code but have not been deployed to the running services.**

### Evidence

1. **ECS Task Definition**
   - Currently running: `hokusai-api-development:67`
   - Last deployment: 2025-08-06 16:34:35 (4:34 PM)
   - Database fix merged: 2025-08-06 17:12:52 (5:12 PM)
   - **Gap: 38 minutes - fix merged after deployment**

2. **Configuration in Running Service**
   ```json
   {
     "DB_USER": "mlflow",  ✅ Correct
     "DB_HOST": "hokusai-mlflow-development...",  ✅ Correct
     "DB_PASSWORD": "from Secrets Manager"  ✅ Configured
   }
   ```

3. **Secret Manager Status**
   - Last updated: 4:29 PM ✅
   - Contains new password
   - Properly referenced in task definition

## Why Tests Failed

### What Was Fixed in PR #70
1. ✅ Database user changed from 'postgres' to 'mlflow'
2. ✅ Password stored in AWS Secrets Manager
3. ✅ Database name corrected to 'mlflow_db'
4. ✅ Connection timeout increased
5. ✅ Health check improvements

### What Tests Found
1. ❌ Service returning 502 errors
2. ❌ "Failed to connect to MLflow server"
3. ❌ Database connection failures

**These failures are from the OLD code, not the fixed code.**

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Current Deployment
```bash
aws ecs describe-services \
  --cluster hokusai-development \
  --services hokusai-api-development \
  --query 'services[0].deployments[0].taskDefinition'
```
Result: Still running `:67` from before the fix

### 2. Check Git History
```bash
git log --oneline -5 origin/main
```
Shows PR #70 merged after deployment time

### 3. Local Validation
The validation script confirms the configuration is correct:
- ✅ Database password from environment
- ✅ User set to 'mlflow'
- ✅ All validations pass locally

## Required Actions

### Immediate Steps
1. **Deploy the latest code to ECS**
   ```bash
   # Update task definition with latest image
   # Force new deployment of service
   ```

2. **Verify New Deployment**
   - Check task definition is `:68` or higher
   - Confirm containers are running new code
   - Verify environment variables are set

3. **Re-run Tests**
   - Execute health checks
   - Test database connectivity
   - Verify MLflow integration

### Expected Results After Deployment

Once the fixes are deployed, we expect:
- ✅ Database connections using 'mlflow' user
- ✅ Successful authentication with Secrets Manager password
- ✅ Health checks passing
- ✅ MLflow connectivity restored
- ✅ Model registration working

## Deployment Commands

To deploy the fixes:

```bash
# Build and push new image
docker build -t hokusai-api .
docker tag hokusai-api:latest <ecr-repo>/hokusai-api:latest
docker push <ecr-repo>/hokusai-api:latest

# Update ECS service
aws ecs update-service \
  --cluster hokusai-development \
  --service hokusai-api-development \
  --force-new-deployment
```

## Monitoring Post-Deployment

After deployment, monitor:
1. ECS service events for successful deployment
2. CloudWatch logs for startup validation
3. Health check endpoints
4. Database connection logs

## Conclusion

The comprehensive tests accurately identified failures because they tested the **currently deployed** system, which does not include the database fixes from PR #70. The discrepancy is not a test issue but a **deployment issue**.

**Next Step**: Deploy the latest code with PR #70 fixes to resolve all database-related failures.
