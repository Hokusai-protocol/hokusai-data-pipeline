# Product Requirements Document: Comprehensive Infrastructure Testing

## Executive Summary

Following the migration to a centralized infrastructure repository, the Hokusai data pipeline requires comprehensive testing to validate all services and identify issues. Current monitoring shows infrastructure health has degraded from 54.5% to 36.4%, with the registry service experiencing 503 errors. This PRD outlines systematic testing of all infrastructure components.

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. Execute comprehensive test suite (67 test functions across 4 categories)
2. Test model registration with live API keys
3. Document all working components
4. Document all failing components for infrastructure team
5. Create comprehensive health report

### Success Criteria
- All 67 test functions executed with results documented
- Model registration tested with live credentials
- Complete documentation of service states
- Actionable recommendations for infrastructure team
- Health report with metrics and trends

## User Personas

### Infrastructure Team
