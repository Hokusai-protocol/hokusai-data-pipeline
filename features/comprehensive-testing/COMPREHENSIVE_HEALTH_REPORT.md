### Service Evolution
- **Previous State**: 404 errors (routing issues)
- **Current State**: 502/503 errors (service failures)
- **Trend**: Significant degradation

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Failures
1. **Service Discovery Breakdown**
   - mlflow.hokusai.local not resolving
   - Cloud Map configuration issues
   - No fallback to direct IPs

2. **Database Connection Failure**
   - Authentication using wrong user (postgres vs mlflow)
   - Secrets Manager not providing password
   - Network security group issues

3. **Internal Networking Issues**
   - Services cannot communicate
   - Security groups blocking traffic
   - VPC routing problems

### Contributing Factors
- Recent infrastructure migration to centralized repository
- Configuration drift between environments
- Lack of health check circuit breaking
- Missing monitoring and alerting

- [ ] Verify RDS is accessible
- [ ] Check Secrets Manager
- [ ] Update database credentials
- [ ] Test connections

### Step 3: Service Validation (Hour 3)
- [ ] Run health checks
- [ ] Test model registration
- [ ] Verify all endpoints
- [ ] Monitor for stability

### Step 4: Communication (Hour 4)
- [ ] Update status page
- [ ] Notify customers
- [ ] Document incident
- [ ] Schedule post-mortem

## Monitoring Requirements

### Critical Metrics to Track
- Service availability (all endpoints)
- Response times (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rates by service
- Database connection pool
- ECS task health
- ALB target health

### Alerting Thresholds
- API availability < 99%
- Response time > 1 second
- Error rate > 1%
- Database connections > 80%
- ECS task restarts > 0

## Conclusion

The Hokusai data pipeline infrastructure is in a critical state requiring immediate intervention. While the underlying AWS infrastructure is healthy, the application layer has completely failed due to service discovery and connectivity issues. The authentication service remains the only fully functional component.

**Estimated Recovery Time**: 4-6 hours with proper access and resources  
**Required Team**: DevOps, Backend, Database Admin  
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Production completely down
