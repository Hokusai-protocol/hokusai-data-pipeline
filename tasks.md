   d. [x] Add step to main pipeline flow

2. [x] Implement training configuration management
   a. [x] Load training hyperparameters from config
   b. [x] Set random seeds for reproducibility (Python, NumPy, framework-specific)
   c. [x] Configure model architecture parameters
   d. [x] Validate configuration parameters

3. [x] Model fine-tuning logic
   a. [x] Load combined dataset from previous step
   b. [x] Initialize model from baseline model
   c. [x] Implement training loop with proper logging
   d. [x] Handle training interruptions gracefully
   e. [x] Add progress tracking and metrics collection

4. [x] MLFlow integration
   a. [x] Log training parameters to MLFlow
   b. [x] Log training metrics (loss, accuracy, etc.) during training
   c. [x] Save model artifacts to MLFlow model registry
   d. [x] Tag model with metadata (version, timestamp, etc.)
   e. [x] Create model signature for downstream usage

## Error Handling and Validation (Dependent on Core Development)

5. [ ] Input validation and error handling

   e. [ ] Implement graceful degradation for recoverable errors

## Testing

6. [x] Write and implement tests
   a. [x] Unit tests for training configuration loading
   b. [x] Unit tests for model initialization and setup
   c. [x] Unit tests for training loop components
   d. [x] Unit tests for MLFlow integration
   e. [x] Integration tests with mock data and baseline model
   f. [x] End-to-end pipeline testing with train_new_model step
   g. [x] Performance tests for training with large datasets

## Documentation (Dependent on Core Development)
