# Implementation Tasks: Test Model Registration

## 1. [x] Environment Setup
   a. [x] Request live API key from user
   b. [x] Set up Python environment with required dependencies
   c. [x] Verify network connectivity to production services
   d. [x] Export API key as environment variable
   e. [x] Confirm all test scripts are present and executable

## 2. [x] Primary Registration Test
   a. [x] Run test_real_registration.py with live API key
   b. [x] Monitor console output for each test phase
   c. [x] Document authentication results
   d. [x] Record MLflow proxy connection status
   e. [x] Capture model registration outcome
   f. [x] Save complete test output to log file

## 3. [x] Additional Verification Tests
   a. [x] Run verify_api_proxy.py for health check
   b. [x] Execute test_bearer_auth.py for auth validation
   c. [x] Run test_auth_service.py for direct auth testing
   d. [x] Compare results across all test scripts
   e. [x] Identify any inconsistencies or failures

## 4. [x] Error Analysis (If Failures Occur)
   a. [x] Analyze specific error codes (401, 403, 404, etc.)
   b. [x] Check API service logs if accessible
   c. [x] Verify API key format and validity
   d. [x] Test network connectivity to each endpoint
   e. [x] Document exact failure points and error messages

## 5. [x] Performance Testing
   a. [x] Measure authentication response time
   b. [x] Record MLflow proxy latency
   c. [x] Time complete registration process
   d. [x] Note any timeouts or slow operations
   e. [x] Compare with expected performance baselines

## 6. [x] Edge Case Testing
   a. [x] Test with invalid API key format
   b. [x] Test with expired or revoked key (if available)
   c. [x] Test concurrent registrations
   d. [x] Test large model upload scenarios
   e. [x] Verify error handling for each case

## 7. [x] Documentation (Dependent on Testing)
   a. [x] Create comprehensive test report
   b. [x] Document all test scenarios and results
   c. [x] Include screenshots or logs of successful registration
   d. [x] List any remaining issues or concerns
   e. [x] Provide clear pass/fail determination

## 8. [x] Follow-up Actions
   a. [x] If tests pass: Confirm deployment success
   b. [x] If tests fail: Create detailed bug report
   c. [x] Update FIXES_APPLIED.md with test results
   d. [x] Notify team of testing outcome
   e. [x] Recommend next steps based on findings

## 9. [x] Root Cause Investigation
   a. [x] Investigate MLflow configuration and endpoints
   b. [x] Analyze auth service API specification
   c. [x] Identify API contract mismatch
   d. [x] Create detailed issue report for auth team
   e. [x] Document all findings in INVESTIGATION_SUMMARY.md
