# Implementation Tasks: Resolve Routing Conflicts

## 1. [x] Analyze Current Routing Configuration
   a. [x] Review ALB routing rules in Terraform configuration
   b. [x] Document all current routing paths with their priorities and destinations
   c. [x] Create a routing map showing all API endpoints and their target services
   d. [x] Identify additional routing conflicts beyond `/api*` issue
   e. [x] Document current workarounds being used

## 2. [x] Design Routing Solution
   a. [x] Analyze pros/cons of each solution option:
      - Option 1: Make ALB rules more specific (e.g., `/api/v1/*` instead of `/api*`)
      - Option 2: Change MLflow proxy paths from `/api/mlflow/*` to `/mlflow-proxy/*`
      - Option 3: Keep current direct MLflow paths (`/mlflow/*`)
   b. [x] Assess backward compatibility impact for each option
   c. [x] Create decision matrix with factors: clarity, compatibility, implementation effort
   d. [x] Select recommended solution with justification
   e. [x] Create detailed routing design document

## 3. [x] Implementation (Dependent on Design Solution)
   a. [x] Update Terraform ALB routing rules if Option 1 selected
   b. [x] Update API proxy code if Option 2 selected
   c. [x] Search for hardcoded API paths in codebase
   d. [x] Update all found hardcoded paths to match new routing
   e. [x] Update environment configuration files

## 4. [x] Documentation
   a. [x] Create comprehensive routing documentation in `/docs/ROUTING.md`
   b. [x] Update API reference documentation with correct paths
   c. [x] Create migration guide if breaking changes are introduced
   d. [x] Update README.md with correct API endpoints
   e. [x] Document routing priorities and conflict resolution

## 5. [x] Testing (Dependent on Documentation)
   a. [x] Write unit tests for routing logic
   b. [x] Create integration tests for all API endpoints
   c. [x] Write specific tests to detect routing conflicts
   d. [x] Test backward compatibility if paths change
   e. [x] Create automated test to verify MLflow proxy access

## 6. [ ] Model Registration Testing (Dependent on Implementation)
   a. [ ] Set up test environment with API key
   b. [ ] Run `test_real_registration.py` with live API key
   c. [ ] Verify authentication passes without errors
   d. [ ] Confirm MLflow connectivity through API proxy
   e. [ ] Document any issues encountered
   f. [ ] Verify model registration completes successfully
   g. [x] Verify auth service continues to work after routing changes

## 7. [ ] Deployment and Monitoring
   a. [ ] Deploy changes to development environment
   b. [ ] Run full test suite in development
   c. [ ] Monitor logs for routing errors
   d. [ ] Create alerts for routing failures
   e. [ ] Deploy to production after verification
   f. [ ] Monitor production for 24 hours post-deployment
