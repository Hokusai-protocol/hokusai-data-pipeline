# Implementation Tasks: Test Model Registration Again2

## 1. Deploy MLflow Container with Artifact Storage
   a. [x] Review `deploy_mlflow_container.sh` script for correctness
   b. [x] Execute deployment script to build and push MLflow container
   c. [x] Monitor ECS service update progress
   d. [x] Verify new container is running with correct entrypoint

## 2. Verify MLflow Deployment Status
   a. [x] Run `verify_mlflow_deployment.sh` to check deployment
   b. [x] Test artifact endpoint availability (should return 200/401, not 404)
   c. [x] Check ECS task definition has correct MLflow image
   d. [x] Verify S3 bucket connectivity from MLflow container

## 3. Test Authentication Flow
   a. [x] Request valid API key from user
   b. [x] Test auth service connectivity with `test_auth_service.py`
   c. [x] Verify bearer token authentication with `test_bearer_auth.py`
   d. [x] Confirm API proxy health with `verify_api_proxy.py`

## 4. Execute Model Registration Tests
   a. [x] Set HOKUSAI_API_KEY environment variable
   b. [x] Run `test_model_registration_simple.py`
   c. [x] Monitor for any 404 errors on artifact endpoints
   d. [ ] Verify model artifacts are uploaded successfully
   e. [ ] Confirm model appears in MLflow registry

## 5. Run Comprehensive End-to-End Test
   a. [x] Execute `test_real_registration.py` with live API key
   b. [x] Verify all checkpoints pass (auth, mlflow, artifacts, registration)
   c. [x] Document any errors or warnings
   d. [ ] Check model retrieval works correctly

## 6. Document Test Results
   a. [x] Create new test report with outcomes
   b. [x] Update FINAL_STATUS_REPORT.md with results
   c. [x] Document any remaining issues or recommendations
   d. [x] Prepare summary for production deployment

## 7. Write and Implement Tests (Dependent on Documentation)
   a. [ ] Database schema tests
   b. [ ] API endpoint tests
   c. [ ] Frontend component tests
   d. [ ] Integration tests
   e. [ ] End-to-end tests

## 8. Cleanup and Preparation for PR
   a. [ ] Remove any temporary test files
   b. [ ] Update documentation with final status
   c. [ ] Ensure all scripts have proper permissions
   d. [ ] Verify no sensitive data in commits
