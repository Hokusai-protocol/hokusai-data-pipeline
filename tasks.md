# Tasks: Model Registration Without MLflow - HA Approach

## Immediate Actions (This Week)

### 1. Improve Error Handling & Circuit Breaker
- [ ] Add exponential backoff retry logic to MLflow connections
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern to avoid repeated failures
- [ ] Add better error messages with MLflow status information
- [ ] Enhance health check in `mlflow_config.py`

### 2. Add Connection Monitoring
- [ ] Create MLflow health check endpoint in API
- [ ] Add monitoring for MLflow connection failures
- [ ] Log MLflow availability metrics to Prometheus
- [ ] Set up alerts for MLflow downtime

## Short-term (Next 2-3 Weeks)

### 3. Database High Availability
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL primary-replica configuration
- [ ] Configure automated failover for database
- [ ] Add database connection pooling
- [ ] Implement database backup strategy

### 4. MLflow Service High Availability
- [ ] Deploy multiple MLflow server instances
- [ ] Set up load balancer (HAProxy/nginx) for MLflow
- [ ] Configure shared storage for MLflow artifacts
- [ ] Add MLflow instance health monitoring

### 5. Storage High Availability
- [ ] Set up MinIO in distributed mode (or migrate to S3)
- [ ] Configure artifact storage redundancy
- [ ] Add backup strategy for model artifacts
- [ ] Test artifact recovery procedures

## Medium-term (Month 2)

### 6. Infrastructure Automation
- [ ] Create Terraform/CloudFormation templates
- [ ] Set up automated deployment pipelines
- [ ] Configure infrastructure monitoring
- [ ] Add disaster recovery procedures

### 7. Advanced Monitoring
- [ ] Set up comprehensive MLflow metrics
- [ ] Create MLflow performance dashboards
- [ ] Add alerting for key metrics (registration failures, response times)
- [ ] Implement log aggregation and analysis

## Testing & Validation

### 8. Chaos Engineering
- [ ] Test MLflow server failures
- [ ] Test database failover scenarios
- [ ] Test storage system failures
- [ ] Validate monitoring and alerting

### 9. Performance Testing
- [ ] Load test MLflow with high registration volume
- [ ] Test failover time and recovery
- [ ] Validate backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Test end-to-end registration reliability

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Current Setup Analysis
- **Single MLflow instance**: `mlflow-server` container
- **Single PostgreSQL**: `postgres` container with health checks
- **Single MinIO**: `minio` container for artifacts
- **Basic monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana already configured

### Required Infrastructure Changes
- **Load Balancer**: HAProxy or nginx for MLflow
- **Database Cluster**: PostgreSQL primary-replica setup
- **Distributed Storage**: MinIO cluster or migrate to AWS S3
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced Prometheus metrics and alerting

### Estimated Costs
- **Development Time**: 2-3 weeks for implementation
- **Infrastructure**: $500-1000/month additional for redundancy
- **Maintenance**: 2-4 hours/week ongoing monitoring and updates

## Success Metrics
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime for model registration
- **Recovery Time**: < 5 minutes for failover
- **Error Rate**: < 0.1% registration failures
- **Performance**: < 2 second registration response time

## Dependencies
- Access to production infrastructure (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Database administration capabilities
- Load balancer and networking configuration
- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure
