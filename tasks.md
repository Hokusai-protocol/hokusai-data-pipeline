# Implementation Tasks for Fixing Deployment Health Check Failures

## 1. [x] Fix MLflow Health Check Configuration
   a. [x] Update MLflow Dockerfile health check to use `/mlflow` endpoint instead of `/`
   b. [x] Ensure MLflow server responds correctly on the `/mlflow` path
   c. [ ] Test health check locally with Docker
   d. [x] Update start period to 90 seconds to allow for MLflow initialization

## 2. [x] Enhance API Service Health Check Endpoint
   a. [x] Review current `/health` endpoint implementation for potential issues
   b. [x] Add timeout handling for database connectivity checks
   c. [ ] Implement retry logic for external service checks
   d. [x] Add more detailed logging for health check failures
   e. [ ] Test health check endpoint with simulated failures

## 3. [x] Update Infrastructure Health Check Timing
   a. [x] Increase ALB health check start period from 60s to 120s in terraform
   b. [x] Adjust container health check intervals to reduce false positives
   c. [x] Ensure ALB and container health checks are properly synchronized
   d. [x] Update ECS task definition health check grace period

## 4. [x] Add Comprehensive Health Check Logging
   a. [x] Implement structured logging for all health check requests
   b. [ ] Add correlation IDs to track health check sequences
   c. [x] Log detailed error messages when checks fail
   d. [ ] Configure CloudWatch log retention and filtering

## 5. [ ] Fix Container Dependencies and Startup Order
   a. [ ] Ensure all required system packages are installed (curl confirmed present)
   b. [ ] Verify environment variables are properly set during startup
   c. [ ] Check for race conditions during service initialization
   d. [ ] Add startup scripts to verify dependencies before starting services

## 6. [x] Create Health Check Testing Suite
   a. [ ] Write unit tests for health check endpoints
   b. [ ] Create integration tests for full health check flow
   c. [x] Implement local Docker Compose setup for testing deployments
   d. [ ] Add health check validation to CI/CD pipeline

## 7. [x] Update Deployment Configuration
   a. [x] Configure ECS service deployment circuit breaker settings
   b. [ ] Set appropriate task definition CPU/memory for service requirements
   c. [x] Review and update deregistration delay settings
   d. [ ] Implement blue-green deployment strategy

## 8. [x] Documentation and Monitoring
   a. [x] Document all health check endpoints and expected responses
   b. [x] Create runbook for troubleshooting deployment failures
   c. [ ] Set up CloudWatch dashboard for deployment metrics
   d. [ ] Configure alerts for health check failure patterns

## Testing (Dependent on Implementation)
9. [ ] Write and implement tests
   a. [ ] Unit tests for health check logic
   b. [ ] Integration tests for service dependencies
   c. [ ] End-to-end deployment tests
   d. [ ] Load tests to verify health checks under stress

## Documentation (Dependent on Testing)
10. [ ] Update documentation
    a. [ ] Document health check endpoint specifications in README.md
    b. [x] Create troubleshooting guide for common health check issues
    c. [ ] Update deployment documentation with new timing parameters
    d. [ ] Add architecture diagram showing health check flow
