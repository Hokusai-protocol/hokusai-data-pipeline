# Final Test Report: Model Registration Status

**Test Date**: 2025-07-17  
**API Key**: `hk_live_chnn8EMMos4Lcwj3i3C3JeAkoNoDcOWL`  
**Test Status**: ❌ **FAILED**

## Executive Summary

Third-party model registration is **still not working** despite previous fix attempts. The API key is being recognized by the system but fails validation with "Invalid or expired API key" errors across all endpoints.

## Test Results Summary

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **API Key Format** | ✅ Recognized | System distinguishes between "API key required" vs "Invalid or expired API key" |
| **Bearer Token Auth** | ❌ Failing | All Bearer token requests return 401 "Invalid or expired API key" |
| **MLflow Direct Access** | ⚠️ Partial | MLflow UI accessible, but API returns 404 on standard endpoints |
| **Proxy Endpoints** | ❌ Failing | All `/api/mlflow/*` endpoints return 401 authentication errors |
| **Auth Service** | ❌ Failing | Key validation fails with "Invalid or expired API key" |

## Detailed Findings

### 1. API Key Recognition vs Validation
The system is **recognizing** the API key format but **failing** validation:
- ❌ With API key: `"Invalid or expired API key"`
- ❌ Without API key: `"API key required"`

This suggests the authentication middleware is working but the key validation logic is failing.

### 2. MLflow Infrastructure Status
**MLflow Service**: ✅ Running at `https://registry.hokus.ai/mlflow/`
- UI is accessible and functional
- Uses non-standard `/ajax-api/2.0/mlflow/*` endpoints (not `/api/2.0/mlflow/*`)
- No authentication required for direct access

### 3. Authentication Patterns Tested
All authentication methods failed:
- Bearer token in Authorization header
- Raw API key in Authorization header  
- API key in X-API-Key header
- API key in X-Hokusai-API-Key header
- API key in request body (JSON)

### 4. Service Configuration Analysis
**Auth Service**: Returns "Invalid or expired API key" for all service IDs tested:
- ml-platform
- mlflow
- api
- model-registry
- hokusai

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: API Key Validation Failure
The API key `hk_live_chnn8EMMos4Lcwj3i3C3JeAkoNoDcOWL` is **not valid** according to the auth service, despite being provided by the user as a live key.

### Possible Causes:
1. **Key Expiration**: The API key may have expired
2. **Key Revocation**: The API key may have been revoked
3. **Service Registration**: The key may not be authorized for the required services
4. **Environment Mismatch**: The key may be for a different environment (staging vs production)
5. **Key Format**: The key format may have changed

### Secondary Issues:
- MLflow endpoint discovery issues (404 on standard paths)
- Proxy routing configuration
- Service ID registration mismatches

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

#### 1. Verify API Key Status
- Check if `hk_live_chnn8EMMos4Lcwj3i3C3JeAkoNoDcOWL` is valid and active
- Confirm the key has permissions for `ml-platform` service
- Verify the key hasn't expired or been revoked

#### 2. Test with Different API Key
- Obtain a fresh API key from the Hokusai platform
- Test with a key that has confirmed access to model registration
- Verify key permissions include MLflow operations

#### 3. Check Service Registration
- Confirm "ml-platform" is a valid service_id in the auth system
- Verify the auth service has the correct service configurations
- Test with alternative service IDs if needed

### Technical Fixes Needed

#### 1. Auth Service Investigation
```bash
# Check auth service logs for key validation failures
# Verify service_id configurations
# Confirm key permissions and expiration
```

#### 2. MLflow Endpoint Standardization
```bash
# Fix MLflow API path routing
# Ensure standard /api/2.0/mlflow/* endpoints work
# Update proxy routing to handle ajax-api format
```

#### 3. Integration Testing
```bash
# Add automated tests for auth flow
# Test key validation with multiple service IDs
# Verify end-to-end registration workflow
```

## Next Steps

### For User
1. **Verify API Key**: Please confirm the API key is valid and has model registration permissions
2. **Generate New Key**: If needed, generate a fresh API key from the Hokusai platform
3. **Check Permissions**: Ensure the key has access to ML platform services

### For Development Team
1. **Auth Service Review**: Investigate why valid keys are failing validation
2. **Service ID Audit**: Verify all required service IDs are properly registered
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Set up automated tests for the complete registration flow

## Test Scripts Available

All test scripts are ready for re-testing once API key issues are resolved:
- `test_real_registration.py` - End-to-end registration test
- `verify_api_proxy.py` - Proxy health checks
- `test_bearer_auth.py` - Bearer token authentication
- `test_auth_service.py` - Direct auth service testing
- `investigate_mlflow.py` - Comprehensive endpoint testing

## Conclusion

The model registration feature **remains blocked** by authentication issues. The problem is not with the code implementation or deployment, but with API key validation. Once a valid API key is provided, the existing test suite can verify that all components work correctly.

**Status**: ❌ **FAILED** - Requires valid API key to proceed
