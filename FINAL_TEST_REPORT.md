# Final Test Report: Model Registration Status - UPDATED

**Test Date**: 2025-07-19  
**API Key**: `hk_live_chnn8EMMos4Lcwj3i3C3JeAkoNoDcOWL`  
**Test Status**: ✅ **AUTHENTICATION FIXED**

## Executive Summary

The AUTH_SERVICE_ID configuration issue has been **successfully resolved**! API keys for the 'platform' service are now accepted. Authentication is working, though MLflow endpoint routing needs adjustment due to ALB routing conflicts.

## Test Results Summary

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **API Key Format** | ✅ Working | API key properly formatted and recognized |
| **Bearer Token Auth** | ✅ Fixed | No more 401 errors - authentication is passing |
| **AUTH_SERVICE_ID** | ✅ Fixed | Correctly configured to 'platform' |
| **MLflow Connectivity** | ✅ Fixed | API tasks can now connect to MLflow |
| **Routing** | ⚠️ Issue Found | `/api*` rule conflicts with MLflow proxy paths |

## Detailed Findings

### 1. AUTH_SERVICE_ID Fix Successfully Deployed
The root cause was identified and fixed:
- **Problem**: API key was registered for 'platform' service, but middleware checked for 'ml-platform'
- **Solution**: Made service_id configurable via AUTH_SERVICE_ID environment variable
- **Result**: ✅ Authentication now working - no more 401 errors!

### 2. MLflow Connectivity Fixed
**Problem**: Internal MLflow load balancer had no listeners, causing timeouts
**Solution**: Updated MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI to use main ALB
**Result**: ✅ API tasks can now start and connect to MLflow

### 3. Routing Conflict Discovered
**Issue**: ALB routing rules have a conflict:
- Priority 100: `/api*` → hokusai-api (catches ALL /api paths)
- Priority 200: `/mlflow/*` → hokusai-mlflow

**Impact**: `/api/mlflow/*` paths go to API service instead of MLflow
**Workaround**: Use `/mlflow/api/2.0/*` paths instead

### 4. Deployment Details
**Current Task Definition**: hokusai-api-development:30
**Environment Variables**:
- AUTH_SERVICE_ID = "platform"
- MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI = "http://registry.hokus.ai/mlflow"

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issues Fixed:
1. ✅ **Service ID Mismatch**: AUTH_SERVICE_ID now correctly set to 'platform'
2. ✅ **MLflow Connectivity**: Fixed broken internal load balancer
3. ✅ **SSL Certificate Error**: Using explicit HTTP URL

### Remaining Issue:
- ⚠️ **Routing Conflict**: `/api*` rule prevents `/api/mlflow/*` from reaching MLflow

## Recommendations

### To Fix the Routing Conflict

#### Option 1: Modify ALB Routing Rules
```hcl
# Change priority 100 rule to be more specific
# Instead of: /api* → hokusai-api
# Use: /api/v1/* → hokusai-api
```

#### Option 2: Remove 'api' from MLflow Proxy Paths
- Change proxy endpoints from `/api/mlflow/*` to `/mlflow-proxy/*`
- This avoids the routing conflict entirely

#### Option 3: Use Direct MLflow Paths
- Access MLflow via `/mlflow/api/2.0/*` instead of `/api/mlflow/*`
- This is the current workaround

### Next Steps

#### For Development Team
1. **Update ALB Routing**: Fix the `/api*` catch-all rule to be more specific
2. **Document Routing**: Clearly document which paths go to which services
3. **Test MLflow Endpoints**: Ensure MLflow API endpoints are properly configured

#### For Users
1. **Authentication Works**: Your API key is valid and authentication is fixed!
2. **Use Correct Paths**: Access MLflow via `/mlflow/*` paths for now
3. **Model Registration**: Should work once MLflow endpoints are configured

## Test Scripts Created

New test scripts that helped diagnose and verify the fix:
- `test_auth_debug.py` - Auth service endpoint discovery
- `test_auth_service_direct.py` - Direct auth service testing
- `check_alb_rules.py` - ALB routing analysis
- `test_routing_conflict.py` - Routing conflict verification
- `test_auth_and_mlflow_final.py` - Final verification test

## Conclusion

The AUTH_SERVICE_ID configuration issue has been **successfully resolved**! The deployment included:

1. ✅ Fixed service_id mismatch (platform vs ml-platform)
2. ✅ Fixed MLflow connectivity (broken internal LB)
3. ✅ Fixed SSL certificate errors
4. ✅ Successfully deployed via Terraform

The only remaining issue is the ALB routing conflict which can be worked around by using `/mlflow/*` paths instead of `/api/mlflow/*` paths.

**Status**: ✅ **AUTHENTICATION FIXED** - Ready for model registration testing!
