# Verification Results Summary

## Critical Discovery

During verification, we discovered that **auth.hokus.ai and registry.hokus.ai point to the SAME Application Load Balancer**. This means the `/api*` routing rule was essential for auth service functionality.

## Verification Steps Completed

### 1. DNS Resolution Check ✅
```bash
dig auth.hokus.ai +short
# Result: hokusai-development-794046971.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com

dig registry.hokus.ai +short  
# Result: hokusai-development-794046971.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com (SAME!)
```

**Finding**: Both domains use the same ALB, so ALB rules affect both services.

### 2. Auth Service Connectivity Test ✅
```bash
curl https://auth.hokus.ai/api/v1/keys/validate -X POST -d '{"api_key": "test", "service_id": "platform"}'
# Result: {"detail":"API key not found or invalid"} (Status: 401)

curl https://auth.hokus.ai/
# Result: {"service":"Hokusai Authentication Service","version":"1.0.0","status":"operational"}
```

**Finding**: Auth service is working and relies on current routing.

### 3. Unversioned Endpoints Check ✅
```bash
grep -r '"/api/' src/ | grep -v '"/api/v1' | grep -v '"/api/mlflow'
# Result: No unversioned endpoints found
```

**Finding**: All API endpoints use `/api/v1/` prefix as expected.

### 4. Host-Based Routing Check ✅
Searched Terraform configs for auth.hokus.ai routing rules.

**Finding**: No host-based rules exist for auth.hokus.ai - it relies on the `/api*` catch-all.

## Updated Solution

Based on these findings, we've updated the routing fix to:

1. **ADD auth-specific routing rules** (Priority 80)
   - `auth.hokus.ai` + `/api/*` → API Target Group
   - Preserves auth service functionality

2. **ADD MLflow proxy rule** (Priority 90)
   - `/api/mlflow/*` → API Target Group
   - Fixes the MLflow routing issue

3. **UPDATE general API rule** (Priority 100)
   - Change from `/api*` to `/api/v1/*`, `/api/health`, `/api/health/*`
   - More specific, allows other `/api/*` paths to be handled separately

## Risk Assessment Update

### Original Risk: HIGH ❌
Changing `/api*` without auth rules would break authentication platform-wide.

### Updated Risk: LOW ✅
With auth-specific rules added first, the change is safe:
- Auth service continues to work
- MLflow routing gets fixed
- No breaking changes

## Testing Requirements

Before deployment, verify ALL of these work:
```bash
# Auth service (CRITICAL)
curl https://auth.hokus.ai/api/v1/keys/validate -X POST -d '{"api_key":"test"}'
# Expected: 401 (not 404!)

# API endpoints
curl https://registry.hokus.ai/api/v1/dspy/health
# Expected: 401 or 200

# MLflow (currently broken, will be fixed)
curl https://registry.hokus.ai/api/mlflow/health
# Expected: 404 now, 200 after fix
```

## Conclusion

The additional verification was critical. We discovered that the `/api*` rule serves a dual purpose - handling both registry.hokus.ai and auth.hokus.ai traffic. The updated solution preserves auth functionality while fixing the MLflow routing issue.
