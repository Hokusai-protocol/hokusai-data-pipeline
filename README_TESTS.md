# Comprehensive Tests for Service Degradation Fixes

This document describes the comprehensive test suite created to validate the service degradation fixes implemented in the Hokusai data pipeline.

## Test Structure

The test suite consists of four main categories:

### 1. Unit Tests for Circuit Breaker Logic
**File**: `tests/unit/test_circuit_breaker_enhanced.py`

**Purpose**: Test the enhanced MLflow circuit breaker implementation with auto-reset, state transitions, and recovery mechanisms.

**Key Test Areas**:
- Initial state validation
- Failure tracking and threshold management
- State transitions (CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN → CLOSED)
- Auto-reset functionality with exponential backoff
- Manual reset capabilities
- Status reporting and metrics
- Edge cases and error conditions

**Example Test Cases**:
- `test_initial_state`: Validates circuit breaker starts in CLOSED state
- `test_half_open_success_recovery`: Tests successful recovery from HALF_OPEN to CLOSED
- `test_exponential_backoff_after_max_attempts`: Tests backoff behavior after max recovery attempts
- `test_force_reset`: Tests manual circuit breaker reset

### 2. Integration Tests for Health Endpoints
**File**: `tests/integration/test_health_endpoints_enhanced.py`

**Purpose**: Test health endpoints with graceful degradation and all health check scenarios with realistic service interactions.

**Key Test Areas**:
- Health check with all services healthy
- Health check with circuit breaker in various states
- Readiness checks with critical vs non-critical service failures
- Detailed health information reporting
- Liveness checks under various conditions
- MLflow-specific health endpoints
- Service recovery scenarios

**Example Test Cases**:
- `test_health_check_mlflow_circuit_breaker_open`: Tests health reporting when MLflow circuit breaker is open
- `test_readiness_check_database_down`: Tests readiness when critical database is down
- `test_gradual_service_degradation`: Tests health reporting during gradual service degradation
- `test_service_recovery_sequence`: Tests health reporting during service recovery

### 3. Load Tests for Service Capacity
**File**: `tests/load/test_service_load.py`

**Purpose**: Test service performance, rate limiting, and graceful degradation under various load conditions.

**Key Test Areas**:
- Sequential load testing
- Concurrent load testing with multiple threads
- Performance under degraded service conditions
- Spike load resilience
- Response time analysis (average, percentiles)
- Error rate monitoring
- Mixed endpoint load testing

**Features**:
- `LoadTestRunner` class for structured load testing
- `LoadTestResult` dataclass for comprehensive result tracking
- Configurable test parameters (threads, requests, timeouts)
- Detailed performance metrics and reporting

**Example Test Cases**:
- `test_health_endpoint_concurrent_load`: Tests concurrent load on health endpoint
- `test_load_with_degraded_services`: Tests load behavior when services are degraded
- `test_spike_load_resilience`: Tests service resilience under sudden load spikes
- `test_response_time_under_sustained_load`: Tests response times under sustained load

### 4. Chaos Engineering Tests
**File**: `tests/chaos/test_failure_recovery.py`

**Purpose**: Test system resilience under various failure conditions and validate recovery mechanisms using chaos engineering principles.

**Key Test Areas**:
- Complete service failure and recovery
- Network partition simulation
- Circuit breaker cascading failure testing
- Service failure isolation
- Recovery mechanism validation
- Timeout handling

**Features**:
- `ChaosTestFramework` for structured chaos experiments
- `ChaosExperiment` and `ChaosResult` dataclasses for experiment tracking
- Automated failure injection and recovery measurement
- Service availability monitoring during failures

**Example Test Cases**:
- `test_mlflow_complete_failure_recovery`: Tests complete MLflow failure and recovery sequence
- `test_circuit_breaker_cascading_failures`: Tests circuit breaker behavior with cascading failures
- `test_network_partition_simulation`: Tests behavior under simulated network partitions
- `test_non_critical_service_failure_isolation`: Tests that non-critical service failures don't affect critical operations

## Running the Tests

### Individual Test Suites

```bash
# Run circuit breaker unit tests
pytest tests/unit/test_circuit_breaker_enhanced.py -v

# Run health endpoint integration tests
pytest tests/integration/test_health_endpoints_enhanced.py -v

# Run load tests
pytest tests/load/test_service_load.py -v -s

# Run chaos engineering tests
pytest tests/chaos/test_failure_recovery.py -v -s
```

### Complete Test Suite

```bash
# Run all service degradation tests
python run_test_suite.py
```

The test suite runner provides:
- Organized execution of all test categories
- Clear pass/fail reporting
- Differentiation between critical and non-critical test failures
- Summary statistics and recommendations

## Test Dependencies

The tests are designed to work with the existing project structure and dependencies:

- **pytest**: Test framework
- **FastAPI TestClient**: For API endpoint testing
- **unittest.mock**: For mocking external dependencies
- **time**: For timing and sleep operations in tests
- **concurrent.futures**: For concurrent load testing
- **statistics**: For performance metrics calculation

## Test Configuration

Tests use the existing `conftest.py` configuration and fixtures:
- MLflow mocking to prevent actual connections
- Environment variable setup for testing
- AWS credential mocking
- Temporary directories and sample data

## Expected Outcomes

### Unit Tests
- **100% pass rate** expected for circuit breaker logic
- Tests validate all state transitions and edge cases
- Coverage of both normal operations and error conditions

### Integration Tests
- **95%+ pass rate** expected for health endpoints
- Tests validate graceful degradation under various failure scenarios
- Proper HTTP status codes and response formats

### Load Tests
- **Response times < 2s** under normal load
- **90%+ success rate** under concurrent load
- **80%+ availability** during service degradation
- Graceful performance degradation under stress

### Chaos Tests
- **System remains responsive** during failures
- **Recovery within expected timeframes** after service restoration
- **Proper isolation** of non-critical service failures
- **Circuit breaker functions correctly** under cascading failures

## Test Metrics and Reporting

Each test category provides detailed metrics:

- **Performance**: Response times, throughput, error rates
- **Availability**: Service uptime during failures
- **Recovery**: Time to recover from failures
- **Isolation**: Impact of individual service failures

## Continuous Integration

These tests are designed to be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:

- **Unit and Integration tests**: Run on every commit
- **Load tests**: Run on major releases or infrastructure changes
- **Chaos tests**: Run periodically or before production deployments

## Troubleshooting Test Failures

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. **Timeout Failures**: Adjust timeout values for slower test environments
3. **Mock Setup Issues**: Verify mock configurations match actual service interfaces
4. **Concurrent Test Failures**: May indicate actual concurrency issues in the code

### Debugging Tips

1. Run tests with `-v -s` flags for verbose output
2. Use `--tb=short` for shorter tracebacks
3. Run individual test methods for focused debugging
4. Check test logs for detailed error information

## Maintenance

- **Update tests** when service interfaces change
- **Adjust thresholds** based on infrastructure capabilities
- **Add new test cases** for new failure scenarios
- **Review and update** chaos experiments based on production incidents

## Contributing

When adding new service degradation features:

1. Add corresponding unit tests for new components
2. Update integration tests for new endpoints or behaviors
3. Consider load test implications of new features
4. Add chaos tests for new failure modes

This comprehensive test suite ensures that service degradation fixes work correctly and maintain system reliability under various conditions.
