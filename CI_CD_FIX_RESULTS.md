# CI/CD Pipeline Fix Results

## Summary

✅ **CI/CD Pipeline Fixed and Working**

The CI/CD pipeline has been successfully fixed and is now properly updating ECS services during deployments.

## What Was Fixed

### Service Name Corrections
- Changed `hokusai-api` → `hokusai-api-development`
- Changed `hokusai-mlflow` → `hokusai-mlflow-development`
- Fixed in both deployment and monitoring sections

### Results
- **Deployment successful**: GitHub Actions workflow completed in 16m38s
- **Services updated**: 
  - API service updated from revision 93 → 97
  - MLflow service updated to revision 24
- **New code deployed**: Including direct IP fix for MLflow and all Redis resilience improvements

## Current Status

### ✅ Working
1. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Now correctly identifies and updates services
2. **Service Updates**: New task definitions are deployed automatically
3. **Build Process**: Docker images built and pushed successfully

### ⚠️ Still Issues
1. **Health Endpoints**: Returning timeouts at ALB level
   - Internal health checks work (200 OK in logs)
   - ALB target health checks timing out
   - Target groups showing unhealthy

2. **Routing Configuration**: 
   - `/health` endpoint routes to correct target group
   - But targets are marked unhealthy due to timeouts

## Evidence of Success

```bash
# Service updated to new revision
PRIMARY deployment: revision 97 (was 93)

# GitHub Actions completed successfully
Status: success
Duration: 16m38s

# Logs show service starting with new code
2025-08-14T13:49:50 - New task started with revision 97
```

## Remaining Issues

### Target Group Health
- `hokusai-reg-api-development`: unhealthy (timeout)
- Health check path: `/health` (correct)
- Timeout: 30 seconds (should be sufficient)

### Possible Causes
1. **Network/Security Group**: Port 8001 might not be accessible from ALB
2. **Service Registration**: Task might not be properly registered with target group
3. **Container Port Mapping**: Mismatch between container port and target group port

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Security Groups**:
   ```bash
   # Check if ALB can reach ECS tasks on port 8001
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups
   ```

2. **Check Task Network Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Verify task has correct network mode and port mappings
   aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition hokusai-api-development:97
   ```

3. **Manual Target Registration** (if needed):
   ```bash
   # Register task IP manually to target group
   aws elbv2 register-targets
   ```

## Conclusion

The CI/CD pipeline fix was **successful** - the pipeline now correctly identifies and updates the ECS services. The deployment process works end-to-end, with new code being built, pushed, and deployed automatically.

However, the services are still not fully accessible due to ALB target health issues. This appears to be an infrastructure/networking issue rather than a CI/CD or application code issue.
