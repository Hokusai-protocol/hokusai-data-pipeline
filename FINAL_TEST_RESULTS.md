# Final Test Results - Model Registration Testing

**Date**: July 23, 2025  
**Time**: 3:00 PM ET  
**Task**: Test Model Registration Again2  
**API Key**: hk_live_chnn8EMMos4Lcwj3i3C3JeAkoNoDcOWL

## Executive Summary

MLflow container has been successfully deployed and is running healthy. Authentication service has been restored and is working properly. However, model registration still fails due to artifact storage routing issues in the API proxy layer.

## Test Results

### 1. Auth Service Test
```
✅ Auth service restored and operational
✅ API key validates successfully (when service_id is not specified)
✅ Health endpoints responding with 200 OK
```

### 2. MLflow Deployment
```
✅ Container rebuilt multiple times to fix exec format errors
✅ Final deployment successful with proper CMD syntax
✅ MLflow container running and healthy in ECS
✅ No more exec format errors in logs
```

### 3. Model Registration Test
```
✅ Authentication working correctly
✅ MLflow connection successful (can list experiments)
✅ Model training completes successfully
❌ Artifact upload fails with 404 errors
❌ Model registration cannot complete
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The remaining issue is that MLflow artifact endpoints (`/api/2.0/mlflow-artifacts/`) are returning 404 errors. This appears to be a routing issue in the API proxy layer, not an MLflow configuration issue.

### Evidence:
1. MLflow container is running and healthy
2. The container was built with `--serve-artifacts` flag
3. Experiments API works correctly
4. Only artifact endpoints fail with 404

### API Proxy Logs:
```
INFO:src.api.routes.mlflow_proxy:Proxying artifact request: api/2.0/mlflow-artifacts/artifacts/...
INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: PUT https://registry.hokus.ai/mlflow/api/2.0/mlflow-artifacts/... "HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND"
```

The proxy is routing to `https://registry.hokus.ai/mlflow/...` which suggests it's trying to route externally instead of to the internal MLflow service.

## Infrastructure Changes Made

1. **Dockerfile.mlflow Updated**:
   - Fixed exec format errors by using proper CMD syntax
   - Added environment variable defaults
   - Ensured `--serve-artifacts` flag is included

2. **Multiple Deployments**:
   - Deployed MLflow container 5 times with various fixes
   - Final deployment successful with AMD64 platform build

3. **API Service Restarted**:
   - Restarted to ensure connection to updated MLflow

## Recommendations

1. **Fix API Proxy Routing**:
   - The API proxy needs to route artifact requests to the internal MLflow service
   - Currently appears to be routing to an external URL

2. **Check MLflow Service Discovery**:
   - Ensure the API can reach MLflow service internally
   - Verify service-to-service communication in ECS

3. **Review Proxy Configuration**:
   - Check how artifact endpoints are handled differently from experiment endpoints
   - May need specific routing rules for artifact paths

## Conclusion

Significant progress has been made:
- ✅ Auth service is operational
- ✅ MLflow container deployed with artifact storage support
- ✅ Container is running healthy without errors

The remaining blocker is API proxy routing for artifact endpoints. This appears to be a configuration issue in the API service that needs to be addressed to complete model registration successfully.
