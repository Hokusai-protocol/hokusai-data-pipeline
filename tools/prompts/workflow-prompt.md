You're an AI engineer assistant. You will help implement 
features from a Linear backlog by following a structured, automated process. The project goals and overall structure are summarized in hokusai_evaluation_pipeline.md

Perform these steps one at a time and confirm before proceeding:

# Feature Implementation Workflow

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Select Task
- Run the Linear backlog tool:
  ```bash
  npx tsx tools/get-backlog.ts
  ```
- Review the output and select a task by providing its title. Number them and prompt the user to select one by choosing a number. s
- The tool will display:
  - Task title
  - Description
  - Labels
  - Current state

### Step 2: Create Git Branch
- When the user selects a task, sanitize the title and create a git branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/<sanitized-title>
  ```

### Step 3: Generate PRD
- Use the prompt in `prd-prompt-template.md`
- Replace `{{PROJECT_SUMMARY}}` with the selected Linear task's title + description
- Save the AI-generated PRD to `prd.md`

### Step 4: Generate Tasks
- Use the prompt in `tasks-prompt-template.md` to convert `prd.md` into a list of actionable dev tasks
- Save these to `tasks.md`

### Step 5: Implement with Tests First
- Find any tasks related to writing tests and implement those first
- Confirm that the tests fail, then implement the remaining tasks to make them pass
- Iterate until all tests pass

### Step 6: Open Pull Request
- When `tasks.md` is complete and all tests pass:
- The GitHub tool will:
  - Commit changes with a descriptive message
  - Push the branch
  - Create a PR using the GitHub CLI
- Run:
  ```bash
  node packages/tools/github.ts
  ```

### Step 7: Ready for Review
- Confirm each of the three steps with checkboxes in the list below have been completed
- Add a checkbox next to them if completed
- Prompt the user to review the PR with the following checklist:

### âœ… Ready for Review

- [x] All tasks in `tasks.md` completed
- [x] Tests pass locally and on CI
- [x] Feature validated on Vercel preview: [preview-link]
- [ ] Reviewer confirmed PRD alignment

## Error Handling

### Linear API Issues
If you encounter Linear API errors:
1. Check your Linear API key:
   - Open Linear and go to Settings > API
   - Generate a new API key if needed
   - Add it to your `.env` file as `LINEAR_API_KEY=your_key_here`
2. Verify the API key is working:
   ```bash
   # Test the Linear API connection
   node packages/tools/get-backlog.ts
   ```
3. If the tool fails, check:
   - Network connectivity
   - Linear API status page
   - Your Linear account permissions

### GitHub Operations
If GitHub operations fail:
1. Verify GitHub CLI setup:
   ```bash
   # Check if GitHub CLI is installed
   gh --version
   
   # Check if you're authenticated
   gh auth status
   ```
2. If not authenticated:
   ```bash
   # Login to GitHub CLI
   gh auth login
   ```
3. Check repository access:
   ```bash
   # Verify you can access the repository
   gh repo view
   ```
4. For uncommitted changes:
   ```bash
   # Check status of your changes
   git status
   ```

### Testing Issues
If tests fail:
1. Review the test output for specific failures
2. Verify your development environment:
   ```bash
   # Check Node version
   node --version
   
   # Verify dependencies
   npm list
   ```
3. Try cleaning and reinstalling:
   ```bash
   # Clean install dependencies
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   ```

## Notes
- Each step should be completed in sequence
- Document any deviations from the standard process
- Keep the PRD and tasks updated as implementation progresses
- Regular commits with clear messages are recommended
- If you need help with environment setup, refer to the project's setup documentation
