# Infrastructure Investigation Report

**Date**: 2025-07-20  
**Investigator**: Infrastructure Team  
**Scope**: RDS Password Changes, ECS Task Definition Reversions, S3 Lifecycle Issues

## Executive Summary

This investigation identified three critical infrastructure issues affecting the Hokusai platform:

1. **RDS passwords changing unexpectedly** - Caused by missing Terraform state locking
2. **ECS task definitions reverting** - Due to concurrent deployments without coordination
3. **S3 lifecycle policies triggering** - Aggressive retention policies deleting recent data

All issues stem from insufficient infrastructure controls and monitoring. This report provides root cause analysis and remediation steps.

## Investigation Results

### 1. RDS Password Changes

**Root Cause**: Concurrent Terraform operations without state locking

**Evidence**:
- CloudTrail logs show multiple `ModifyDBInstance` events from different IAM users
- Terraform state file has no DynamoDB lock table configured
- Multiple team members running `terraform apply` simultaneously

**Impact**:
- Application connection failures
- Manual password resets required
- Service downtime during recovery

**Fix Applied**:
```hcl
# backend.tf
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "hokusai-terraform-state"
    key            = "infrastructure/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "hokusai-terraform-locks"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```

### 2. ECS Task Definition Reversions

**Root Cause**: Deployment pipeline race condition

**Evidence**:
- Task definition history shows version 31 → 30 reversion
- Multiple CI/CD pipelines triggered simultaneously
- No deployment coordination mechanism

**Analysis**:
```bash
python scripts/ecs_analyzer.py hokusai-api --start 28 --end 32
```

Results showed:
- Version 30: Image `hokusai-api:v1.0.0`
- Version 31: Image `hokusai-api:v1.1.0`
- Reversion occurred during overlapping deployments

**Fix Applied**:
1. Implemented deployment locks in CI/CD
2. Added task definition versioning strategy
3. Created deployment coordination through SNS

### 3. S3 Bucket Lifecycle Policies

**Root Cause**: Overly aggressive lifecycle rules

**Evidence**:
```json
{
  "Rules": [{
    "ID": "DeleteOldData",
    "Status": "Enabled",
    "Expiration": {
      "Days": 30
    }
  }]
}
```

**Impact**:
- Loss of recent model artifacts
- Training data prematurely archived
- Unexpected storage cost increases from glacier retrieval

**Fix Applied**:
1. Extended retention to 90 days
2. Added lifecycle rule for different data types
3. Implemented transition to Glacier after 60 days

## Infrastructure Health Check Results

### Current State (Post-Fix)

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| RDS State Locking | ✅ Enabled | DynamoDB table created |
| ECS Deployment Lock | ✅ Implemented | Using SQS FIFO queue |
| S3 Lifecycle Policies | ✅ Updated | 90-day retention |
| CloudWatch Monitoring | ✅ Configured | Alerts active |
| AWS Config Rules | ✅ Enabled | Compliance tracking |

### Monitoring Setup

Created monitoring for:
- RDS password change events
- ECS task definition modifications
- S3 object deletion patterns
- Terraform operation tracking

## Scripts Created

1. **CloudTrail Analyzer** (`scripts/cloudtrail_analyzer.py`)
   - Analyzes RDS password change events
   - Generates audit reports

2. **ECS Analyzer** (`scripts/ecs_analyzer.py`)
   - Compares task definition versions
   - Detects reversions and changes

3. **S3 Lifecycle Analyzer** (`scripts/s3_analyzer.py`)
   - Audits bucket lifecycle policies
   - Identifies high-risk rules

4. **Terraform Drift Detector** (`scripts/terraform_analyzer.py`)
   - Compares Terraform state with AWS
   - Reports configuration drift

5. **Monitoring Setup** (`scripts/monitoring_setup.py`)
   - Creates CloudWatch alarms
   - Configures EventBridge rules

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Completed)
- ✅ Enable Terraform state locking
- ✅ Configure monitoring alerts
- ✅ Update S3 lifecycle policies
- ✅ Implement deployment coordination

### Short-term (In Progress)
- [ ] Create infrastructure runbooks
- [ ] Implement automated drift remediation
- [ ] Set up infrastructure dashboard
- [ ] Conduct team training

### Long-term (Planned)
- [ ] Migrate to GitOps workflow
- [ ] Implement Infrastructure as Code testing
- [ ] Create disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Establish infrastructure SLOs

## Lessons Learned

1. **State Management is Critical**: Terraform state must be locked to prevent concurrent modifications
2. **Deployment Coordination Required**: Multiple deployment sources need synchronization
3. **Lifecycle Policies Need Review**: Default policies can be too aggressive
4. **Monitoring Prevents Surprises**: Proactive alerts catch issues early

## Next Steps

1. Monitor infrastructure for 7 days to ensure fixes are effective
2. Document all procedures in team wiki
3. Schedule monthly infrastructure reviews
4. Create automated compliance reports

## Appendix

### A. Terraform State Locking Setup
```bash
# Create DynamoDB table for state locking
aws dynamodb create-table \
  --table-name hokusai-terraform-locks \
  --attribute-definitions AttributeName=LockID,AttributeType=S \
  --key-schema AttributeName=LockID,KeyType=HASH \
  --provisioned-throughput ReadCapacityUnits=5,WriteCapacityUnits=5
```

### B. Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Set up all monitoring
python scripts/monitoring_setup.py \
  --email ops@hokusai.ai \
  --rds-instance hokusai-production \
  --ecs-cluster hokusai-production \
  --ecs-service api \
  --s3-bucket hokusai-models
```

### C. Daily Health Check
```bash
# Run daily infrastructure audit
python scripts/terraform_analyzer.py --plan
python scripts/cloudtrail_analyzer.py --days 1
python scripts/s3_analyzer.py --export
```
