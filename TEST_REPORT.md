# Model Registration Test Report

**Date**: 2025-07-17  
**API Key Used**: hk_live_chnn8EMMos4Lcwj3i3C3JeAkoNoDcOWL  
**Test Status**: ❌ **FAILED**

## Executive Summary

The model registration tests have **FAILED** due to authentication issues. All endpoints are returning 401 "Invalid or expired API key" errors, indicating that either:
1. The provided API key is invalid/expired
2. The authentication service is not properly validating the key
3. The fixes from PR #49 have not been deployed to production

## Test Results

### 1. Primary Registration Test (`test_real_registration.py`)

- **Status**: ❌ FAILED
- **Key Findings**:
  - API proxy endpoints return 401 "Invalid or expired API key"
  - MLflow direct access returns 404 (endpoint not found)
  - Fallback to Hokusai SDK also failed
  - No successful model registration achieved

### 2. Authentication Service Test (`test_auth_service.py`)

- **Status**: ❌ FAILED
- **Key Findings**:
  - Direct validation requests return 401 "API key required"
  - Bearer token in header also returns 401
  - Auth service is operational (health check passes)
  - The service expects the API key in a different format than what was fixed

### 3. Bearer Token Test (`test_bearer_auth.py`)

- **Status**: ❌ FAILED
- **Key Findings**:
  - Bearer token authentication returns 401
  - MLflow client with Bearer token fails
  - Direct MLflow access returns 404

### 4. API Proxy Verification (`verify_api_proxy.py`)

- **Status**: ❌ FAILED
- **Key Findings**:
  - Main API service is running (health check passes)
  - All authenticated endpoints return 401
  - MLflow proxy endpoints exist but reject the API key
  - Direct MLflow endpoints return 404

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Authentication Failure

The API key `hk_live_chnn8EMMos4Lcwj3i3C3JeAkoNoDcOWL` is being rejected by all endpoints with "Invalid or expired API key". This indicates one of:

1. **The API key is actually invalid/expired**
   - Need to verify with the team if this key is still valid
   - May need a fresh API key for testing

2. **The auth service expects a different format**
   - The auth service test shows it's expecting the API key differently
   - When sending in JSON body, it returns "API key required"
   - When sending in Bearer header, it returns "Invalid or expired API key"

3. **The fixes haven't been deployed**
   - The behavior matches the pre-fix state exactly
   - All the same error messages are appearing

### Secondary Issue: MLflow Endpoints

- Direct MLflow access at `https://registry.hokus.ai/mlflow` returns 404
- This suggests MLflow may not be deployed at this URL
- Or it may require authentication even for basic access

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Verify API Key Status**
   - Confirm if `hk_live_chnn8EMMos4Lcwj3i3C3JeAkoNoDcOWL` is still valid
   - Request a new API key if this one has expired

2. **Confirm Deployment Status**
   - Verify if PR #49 fixes have been deployed to production
   - Check deployment logs for any errors

3. **Debug Auth Service**
   - The auth service appears to be running but not accepting the API key
   - Need to check auth service logs to see why validation is failing

### Next Steps

1. **If API key is valid**:
   - The auth service has a different issue than what was fixed
   - May need to debug the auth service directly
   - Check if the service_id "ml-platform" is recognized

2. **If API key is invalid**:
   - Request a new valid API key
   - Re-run all tests with the new key

3. **If fixes not deployed**:
   - Deploy the fixes from PR #49
   - Re-run tests after deployment

## Test Artifacts

- Complete test logs saved to: `test_results.log`
- Test scripts used:
  - `test_real_registration.py`
  - `test_auth_service.py`
  - `test_bearer_auth.py`
  - `verify_api_proxy.py`

## Conclusion

The model registration functionality is **NOT WORKING** for third parties. The authentication layer is rejecting all requests with the provided API key. This needs to be resolved before third parties can successfully register models on the Hokusai platform.
