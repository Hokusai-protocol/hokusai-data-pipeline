# Model Registration Test Report - Auth Service Update

**Date**: 2025-08-05 (15:00 UTC)  
**Tester**: Hokusai Data Pipeline Team  
**API Key Used**: hk_live_chnn8EMMos4Lcwj3i3C3JeAkoNoDcOWL (existing key)

## Executive Summary

Following auth service improvements, model registration testing was re-conducted. The auth service is now operational (returning 200 OK instead of 502), representing a significant improvement. However, MLflow proxy routing issues persist, preventing full model registration functionality.

### Overall Status: ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPROVED
- **Infrastructure Health Score**: 54.5% (6/11 checks passed) - Improved from 45.5%
- **Authentication Success Rate**: 10.0% (2/20 tests passed) - Improved from 5.0%
- **Model Registration Success**: 25.0% (1/4 stages passed) - Unchanged
- **Endpoint Availability**: 54.5% (6/11 endpoints reachable) - Similar

## Critical Issues Update

### 1. ✅ Auth Service Fixed - RESOLVED
**Previous Issue**: Auth service returning 502 Bad Gateway  
**Current Status**: Auth service now returns 200 OK  
**Impact**: Auth service is operational but API key validation still failing

**Evidence**:
- `/health` endpoint returns 200 OK (was 502)
- Response time: ~120ms (healthy)
- Service running with 1/1 tasks

### 2. ❌ MLflow Proxy Routes Still Missing - CRITICAL
**Impact**: All MLflow operations fail with 404  
**Affected Endpoints**: All `/api/mlflow/*` endpoints
- `/api/mlflow/api/2.0/mlflow/experiments/search` - Still 404
- `/api/mlflow/api/2.0/mlflow/runs/create` - Still 404
- `/api/mlflow/api/2.0/mlflow/model-versions/create` - Still 404

**Root Cause**: ALB listener rules not configured for MLflow proxy paths

### 3. ⚠️ API Key Validation Issue - NEW
**Impact**: Valid API key being rejected as "Invalid or expired"  
**Affected Endpoints**: All authenticated endpoints return 401
- Direct API endpoints exist but reject authentication
- May indicate database connectivity or key validation logic issue

## Test Results Comparison

| Metric | Previous Test | Current Test | Change |
|--------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| **Infrastructure Health** | 45.5% | 54.5% | ✅ +9.0% |
| **Auth Service Status** | 502 Error | 200 OK | ✅ Fixed |
| **Auth Success Rate** | 5.0% | 10.0% | ✅ +5.0% |
| **Model Registration** | 25.0% | 25.0% | — No change |
| **ECS Services Running** | 3/3 | 3/3 | ✅ Stable |

### Improvements Since Last Test
1. **Auth Service Restored**: Now returning 200 OK instead of 502
2. **Health Check Improvements**: Infrastructure health score increased to 54.5%
3. **Service Stability**: All ECS services remain running (3/3)
4. **Authentication Tests**: Minor improvement in success rate (10% vs 5%)

### Remaining Issues
1. **MLflow Proxy Routes**: Still returning 404 - no ALB routing configured
2. **API Key Validation**: Key rejected as invalid despite auth service being up
3. **Direct API Access**: Endpoints exist but authentication failing

## Detailed Test Results

### Infrastructure Health Check
```
Total Checks: 11

Key Findings:
- Auth service health: ✅ 200 OK
- ECS services: ✅ All running (3/3)
- MLflow routes: ❌ Still 404
```

### Authentication Testing

❌ Failed: 18
Success Rate: 10.0%

Issues:
- Bearer token auth: 404 errors
- X-API-Key auth: 404 errors for MLflow
- API key validation: Rejected as unauthorized
```

### Model Registration Flow
```
Stage 1: ✅ Local model creation
Stage 2: ❌ MLflow experiment creation (404)
Stage 3: ❌ Model run logging (404)
Stage 4: ❌ Model registration (404)

Success Rate: 25.0%
```

### Endpoint Availability
```
Available: 6 endpoints (returning 401)
- /api/models/register
- /api/models
- /api/health/mlflow
- /api/health/mlflow/detailed
- /api/health
- /api/2.0/mlflow/experiments/search

Unavailable: 5 endpoints (returning 404)
- All /api/mlflow/* proxy routes
```

## Recommendations for Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Configure MLflow Proxy Routes** (Priority 1)
   ```terraform
   # Add to ALB listener rules
   condition {
     path_pattern {
       values = ["/api/mlflow/*"]
     }
   }
   action {
     type = "forward"
     target_group_arn = aws_lb_target_group.mlflow.arn
   }
   ```

2. **Fix API Key Validation** (Priority 1)
   - Check database connectivity from auth service
   - Verify API key exists in database
   - Review auth service logs for validation errors
   - Test with newly created API key

3. **Verify MLflow Service Configuration** (Priority 2)
   - Ensure MLflow container is listening on correct port
   - Check environment variables for MLflow
   - Verify health check configuration

### Testing Commands for Verification

```bash
# Test auth service directly
curl -v https://auth.hokus.ai/api/v1/keys/validate \
  -H "X-API-Key: hk_live_chnn8EMMos4Lcwj3i3C3JeAkoNoDcOWL"

# Check if MLflow is accessible internally
aws ecs execute-command --cluster hokusai-development \
  --task <api-task-id> \
  --container api \
  --interactive \
  --command "curl http://localhost:5000/api/2.0/mlflow/experiments/search"

# View auth service logs
aws logs tail /ecs/hokusai-auth-development --follow
```

## Conclusion

The auth service fix represents significant progress - it's now operational and responding correctly. However, model registration remains blocked due to:

1. **MLflow proxy routing not configured** - Requires ALB listener rule updates
2. **API key validation failing** - Despite auth service being up, keys are rejected

Once these two issues are resolved, the model registration workflow should be fully functional.

## Next Test

After implementing the ALB routing fixes and resolving API key validation:
1. Create a new API key through the auth service
2. Re-run the complete test suite with the new key
3. Validate end-to-end model registration workflow
