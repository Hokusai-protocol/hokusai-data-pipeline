## Test Date: 2025-07-17

## Test Results Summary

### ❌ FAILED: Third-party model registration is NOT working

## Detailed Findings

### 1. API Key Authentication
- **Bearer Token Auth**: ❌ Returns "Invalid or expired API key"
- **X-API-Key Header**: ❌ Returns "Invalid or expired API key"
- **Status**: The provided API key appears to be invalid or expired

### 2. API Endpoints Status

| Endpoint | Auth Required | Status | Response |
|----------|--------------|--------|----------|
| `/health` | No | ✅ 200 | Service healthy |
| `/api/health` | Yes | ❌ 401 | Invalid API key |
| `/api/models` | Yes | ❌ 401 | Invalid API key |
| `/mlflow/health/mlflow` | Yes | ❌ 404 | Not Found |
| `/mlflow/api/2.0/mlflow/experiments/search` | Yes | ❌ 404 | Not Found |

### 3. Infrastructure Observations

1. **API Service**: ✅ Running and accessible
2. **Authentication Middleware**: ✅ Working (rejecting invalid keys)
3. **MLflow Proxy Route**: ❌ Returns 404 for all MLflow paths
4. **Direct MLflow Access**: ❌ Also returns 404

### 4. Root Causes Identified

1. **Invalid API Key**: The provided key is being rejected by the auth service
   - Need a valid API key to proceed with testing
   
2. **MLflow Proxy Issues**: 
   - The `/mlflow/*` route exists in OpenAPI spec
   - But all MLflow endpoints return 404
   - This suggests MLflow backend is not running or not properly connected

3. **No `/api/mlflow` Route**:
   - The expected `/api/mlflow` route doesn't exist
   - Only `/mlflow` route is available
   - This doesn't match the infrastructure documentation

## Test Scripts Results

### `test_real_registration.py`
- ❌ Failed - Invalid API key
- ❌ MLflow endpoints return 404
- ❌ SDK fallback failed due to missing model parameter

### `verify_api_proxy.py`
- ✅ Confirmed API service is running
- ❌ All authenticated endpoints rejected the API key
- ❌ MLflow proxy endpoints not accessible

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Valid API Key**: 
   - Verify the provided API key is active
   - Or provide a new valid API key for testing

2. **MLflow Backend**:
   - Check if MLflow server is running
   - Verify MLFLOW_SERVER_URL environment variable
   - Check network connectivity between API and MLflow

3. **Routing Configuration**:
   - The `/api/mlflow` route doesn't exist as expected
   - Only `/mlflow` route is in the OpenAPI spec
   - May need to update ALB routing or API configuration

### Code Status

The Bearer token authentication code is implemented correctly:
- ✅ Middleware extracts Bearer tokens
- ✅ Auth service validates tokens
- ✅ Tests show the auth flow works (rejects invalid tokens)

The issue is not with the Bearer token implementation but with:
1. Invalid/expired API key
2. MLflow backend not accessible
3. Routing configuration mismatch

## Root Causes Identified (UPDATED)

After deeper investigation, the actual root causes are:

1. **Authentication Middleware Bug**: The middleware sends the API key in the JSON body, but the auth service expects it in the Authorization header. This causes ALL valid API keys to be rejected.

2. **MLflow Backend Not Configured**: The `MLFLOW_SERVER_URL` environment variable is not set in production, causing the proxy to try to reach `http://localhost:5000` which doesn't exist.

## Conclusion

**Third-party model registration is currently not functional** due to:
1. ❌ **Code Bug**: Authentication middleware sends API key incorrectly
2. ❌ **Missing Config**: MLflow backend URL not configured
3. ❌ **No MLflow Service**: MLflow backend not running/accessible

The Bearer token authentication design is correct, but the implementation has a critical bug. Additionally, the infrastructure is incomplete.

## Required Actions

1. **Fix the auth middleware** to send API key in Authorization header
2. **Configure MLFLOW_SERVER_URL** environment variable
3. **Ensure MLflow backend** is running and accessible
4. **Redeploy the API service** with these fixes
