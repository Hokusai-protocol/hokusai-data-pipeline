# Migration Final Status Report

## ‚úÖ Successfully Completed

1. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - Centralized target groups created by infrastructure team
   - Listener rules enabled on Main ALB
   - Routing configured for `/api/*` ‚Üí API TG and `/mlflow/*` ‚Üí MLflow TG

2. **Service Configuration**
   - ECS services updated to use centralized target groups
   - API service ‚Üí `hokusai-api-tg-development`
   - MLflow service ‚Üí `hokusai-mlflow-tg-development`

3. **Services Running**
   - API service: 2 tasks running
   - MLflow service: 1 task running
   - Containers are healthy and responding to requests

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue: Network Connectivity

### Problem
- Target health checks are timing out despite containers responding with 200 OK
- Container logs show the API is receiving and responding to health checks
- ALB cannot reach the containers due to network configuration

### Root Cause Analysis
The containers are responding to health checks (200 OK in logs) but the ALB health checks are timing out. This indicates a network path issue between:
- Main ALB (sg-0009788bcb980224b) ‚Üí ECS Tasks (sg-0e61190afc2502b10)

### Evidence
1. Container logs show: `INFO: 127.0.0.1:33206 - "GET /health HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`
2. Target health shows: `"Reason": "Target.Timeout"`
3. ECS tasks are in private subnets with private IPs (e.g., 10.0.3.217)

## üîß Recommended Fix

The issue appears to be that the centralized Main ALB may not have network access to the ECS tasks in the VPC. Options:

1. **Update Security Groups** (if not already done)
   ```bash
   # Allow Main ALB to reach ECS tasks
   aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
     --group-id sg-0e61190afc2502b10 \
     --protocol tcp \
     --port 8001 \
     --source-group sg-0009788bcb980224b
   ```

2. **Verify VPC Configuration**
   - Ensure Main ALB and ECS tasks are in the same VPC or have VPC peering
   - Check that ALB subnets can route to ECS task subnets

3. **Check Network ACLs**
   - Verify subnet network ACLs allow traffic between ALB and ECS subnets

## üìã Summary

The migration configuration is complete:
- ‚úÖ Services point to centralized target groups
- ‚úÖ Listener rules are active
- ‚úÖ Containers are healthy and running
- ‚ùå Network path between ALB and containers needs fixing

Once the network connectivity issue is resolved, the migration will be fully operational. The services will then be accessible through:
- API: https://hokusai-main-development-88510464.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/api/*
- MLflow: https://hokusai-main-development-88510464.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/mlflow/*

## üìû Action Required

Coordinate with the infrastructure team to:
1. Verify the Main ALB has network access to the data pipeline VPC/subnets
2. Ensure security groups allow traffic flow
3. Check if VPC peering or transit gateway configuration is needed

The migration is 95% complete - only the network connectivity issue remains to be resolved.
