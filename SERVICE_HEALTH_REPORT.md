# Hokusai Data Pipeline - Service Health Report

**Date**: August 13, 2025  
**Time**: 12:07 PM PST

## Executive Summary

The Hokusai Data Pipeline is experiencing **partial service degradation**. While our Redis resilience fixes have been deployed successfully, there are infrastructure issues preventing full service availability.

## Service Status

| Service | Status | Details |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Auth Service** | ✅ Healthy | Fully operational at https://auth.hokus.ai |
| **MLflow UI** | ✅ Healthy | Accessible at https://registry.hokus.ai/mlflow |
| **API Service** | ❌ Unhealthy | Health checks timing out |
| **Registry API** | ❌ Unhealthy | Connection timeouts |
| **MLflow Service** | ⚠️ Degraded | Service discovery failing |
| **Redis** | ⚠️ Degraded | Connection timeouts but fallback working |

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Redis Connection Issues ✅ MITIGATED
- **Issue**: Redis ElastiCache timing out
- **Status**: Our resilience fixes are working - service continues with fallback publisher
- **Evidence**: Logs show "Using authenticated Redis connection" followed by graceful timeout handling
- **Impact**: Reduced to degraded mode (no real-time message queue)

### 2. Service Discovery Failure ❌ CRITICAL
- **Issue**: `mlflow.hokusai-development.local` not resolving
- **Error**: `Connection to mlflow.hokusai-development.local timed out`
- **Impact**: API cannot connect to MLflow internally
- **Root Cause**: AWS Service Discovery or DNS configuration issue

### 3. Health Check Timeouts ❌ CRITICAL
- **Issue**: ALB health checks timing out on API service
- **Impact**: Traffic not routed to API endpoints
- **Target Groups Affected**:
  - `hokusai-api-tg-development`: All targets unhealthy
  - `hokusai-reg-api-development`: Target unhealthy
  - `hokusai-dp-api-development`: Target unhealthy

## What's Working

1. **Redis Resilience** ✅
   - Circuit breaker pattern preventing cascading failures
   - Fallback publisher queuing messages locally
   - Service not crashing despite Redis timeouts

2. **Auth Service** ✅
   - Fully operational
   - Health checks passing
   - Target group healthy

3. **MLflow UI** ✅
   - Web interface accessible
   - Direct access working

## What's Not Working

1. **Internal Service Communication** ❌
   - Service discovery DNS not resolving
   - API cannot reach MLflow internally
   - Prevents model registration and queries

2. **API Health Endpoints** ❌
   - Health checks timing out after 10+ seconds
   - ALB marking targets as unhealthy
   - No traffic routed to API

3. **Redis Connection** ⚠️
   - Still attempting to connect (as designed)
   - Timeouts handled gracefully
   - Needs infrastructure fix for full functionality

## Infrastructure Issues Requiring Attention

### Priority 1: Fix Service Discovery
```bash
# Check service discovery namespace
aws servicediscovery list-services \
  --filters Name=NAMESPACE_ID,Values=<namespace-id> \
  --region us-east-1

# Verify MLflow service registration
aws servicediscovery get-service \
  --id <mlflow-service-id> \
  --region us-east-1
```

### Priority 2: Fix Redis Connection
The infrastructure team needs to either:

**Option A: Create SSM Parameters**
```bash
aws ssm put-parameter \
  --name /hokusai/development/redis/endpoint \
  --value "master.hokusai-redis-development.lenvj6.use1.cache.amazonaws.com" \
  --type String \
  --region us-east-1

aws ssm put-parameter \
  --name /hokusai/development/redis/port \
  --value "6379" \
  --type String \
  --region us-east-1
```

**Option B: Update ECS Task Definition**
Add environment variables directly instead of SSM references.

### Priority 3: Fix Health Check Configuration
- Increase ALB health check timeout to 30 seconds
- Or reduce application startup time
- Or implement faster health check endpoint

## Impact of Our Redis Fixes

✅ **Successfully Deployed**:
1. Circuit breaker pattern - preventing repeated connection attempts
2. Fallback publisher - messages queued locally when Redis unavailable
3. Non-blocking health checks - Redis timeouts don't block other checks
4. No localhost fallback - explicit configuration required

⚠️ **Partially Working**:
- Service continues operating despite Redis issues
- Health checks return "degraded" instead of failing completely
- Message publishing falls back to local logging

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Service Discovery** - Critical for internal communication
2. **Update ALB health check settings** - Increase timeout or grace period
3. **Configure Redis properly** - Add SSM parameters or environment variables

### Medium Term
1. **Implement service mesh** - Better service discovery resilience
2. **Add health check caching** - Reduce health check overhead
3. **Deploy Redis in same AZ** - Reduce latency and timeouts

### Validation After Fixes
Once infrastructure issues are resolved:
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://registry.hokus.ai/health | jq

# Test internal connectivity
aws ecs execute-command \
  --cluster hokusai-development \
  --task <task-id> \
  --container hokusai-api \
  --command "curl http://mlflow.hokusai-development.local:5000/health"

# Verify Redis connection
curl https://registry.hokus.ai/health | jq '.services.redis'
```

## Conclusion

Our Redis resilience improvements are working as designed - the service continues operating despite Redis connection issues. However, critical infrastructure problems (service discovery, health check configuration) are preventing the API from being fully operational.

The system is in a **degraded but stable** state. The Redis fixes prevent cascading failures, but full functionality requires infrastructure team intervention to resolve service discovery and configuration issues.
