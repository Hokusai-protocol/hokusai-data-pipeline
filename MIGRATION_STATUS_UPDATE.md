# Migration Status Update - Services Updated

## ‚úÖ Completed Actions

1. **Listener Rules Enabled** - Infrastructure team has successfully:
   - Created listener rules on Main ALB
   - Attached target groups to load balancer
   - Configured routing for `/api/*` and `/mlflow/*`

2. **ECS Services Updated** - Both services now point to centralized target groups:
   - API Service ‚Üí `hokusai-api-tg-development`
   - MLflow Service ‚Üí `hokusai-mlflow-tg-development`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue: Health Check Failures

The ECS tasks are running but showing as UNHEALTHY, preventing them from registering with the target groups.

### Possible Causes:

1. **Health Check Path Mismatch**
   - Centralized target groups may have different health check paths
   - Current health checks: `/health` for API, `/mlflow` for MLflow

2. **Security Group Issues**
   - Tasks may not be able to receive health checks from the ALB
   - Need to verify security group rules allow traffic from ALB

3. **Container Health Issues**
   - Containers may not be starting properly with new configuration

## üîç Troubleshooting Commands

```bash
# Check target group health check configuration
aws elbv2 describe-target-groups \
  --target-group-arns arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:932100697590:targetgroup/hokusai-api-tg-development/d9c29f02e2a38c81 \
  --query 'TargetGroups[*].[TargetGroupName,HealthCheckPath,HealthCheckPort,Matcher.HttpCode]'

# Check ECS task logs
aws logs tail /ecs/hokusai/api/development --follow

# Check security groups
aws ec2 describe-security-groups \
  --group-ids $(aws ecs describe-services --cluster hokusai-development --services hokusai-api --query 'services[0].networkConfiguration.awsvpcConfiguration.securityGroups[0]' --output text)
```

## üìä Service Status

| Service | Status | Tasks | Target Group | Health |
|---------|--------|-------|--------------|--------|
| hokusai-api | ACTIVE | 2 running | Centralized TG | UNHEALTHY |
| hokusai-mlflow | ACTIVE | 1 running | Centralized TG | Unknown |

## üö¶ Next Steps

1. **Investigate Health Check Configuration**
   - Compare health check settings between old and new target groups
   - Verify containers respond correctly to health check paths

2. **Check Security Group Rules**
   - Ensure ECS task security group allows inbound traffic from ALB security group
   - Verify ALB security group can reach ECS tasks

3. **Review Container Logs**
   - Check for startup errors or configuration issues
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly

## üìù Notes

- Services successfully switched to centralized target groups
- Deployment is in progress but blocked by health check failures
- Once health checks pass, traffic will route through centralized ALBs

The migration is technically complete from a configuration standpoint, but operational issues need to be resolved for the services to become healthy and receive traffic.
