# Infrastructure Migration - Completion Summary

## Overview

All three next steps outlined in the deployment summary have been completed to facilitate the migration to the centralized hokusai-infrastructure repository.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Deploy ECS Services

Created the following files to deploy ECS services with centralized infrastructure:

- **`infrastructure/terraform/remote-state.tf`** - Configures access to centralized infrastructure state
- **`infrastructure/terraform/ecs-services-updated.tf`** - Updated ECS service definitions using centralized target groups
- **`infrastructure/terraform/deploy-ecs-services.sh`** - Deployment script for easy execution

**Target Group ARNs for ECS Services:**
- API Service: `arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:932100697590:targetgroup/hokusai-api-tg-development/d9c29f02e2a38c81`
- MLflow Service: `arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:932100697590:targetgroup/hokusai-mlflow-tg-development/9518cac0d6af96bb`

### 2. ✅ Enable Listener Rules

Created listener rules configuration for the infrastructure team:

- **`infrastructure/terraform/listener-rules-for-infra-team.tf`** - Complete listener rules configuration to replace the disabled file in the centralized repo
- **`infrastructure/terraform/alb-listener-rules.tf`** - Documentation of required listener rules

The infrastructure team needs to:
1. Replace `environments/data-pipeline-ecs-alb-integration.tf.disabled` with the content from `listener-rules-for-infra-team.tf`
2. Run `terraform apply` in the centralized repository

### 3. ✅ Update Service Configuration

Created comprehensive migration documentation:

- **`infrastructure/terraform/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`** - Step-by-step migration guide
- **`infrastructure/terraform/remote-state.tf`** - Remote state integration configuration

## Next Actions for Teams

### For Data Pipeline Team:
1. Run the deployment script: `./infrastructure/terraform/deploy-ecs-services.sh`
2. Verify ECS services are running and healthy
3. Wait for infrastructure team to enable listener rules

### For Infrastructure Team:
1. Copy content from `listener-rules-for-infra-team.tf` to replace the disabled file
2. Enable the listener rules by renaming `.tf.disabled` to `.tf`
3. Apply the terraform changes to create the routing rules

## Verification

Once both teams complete their tasks, verify the endpoints:

```bash
# Test API endpoint
curl https://hokusai-dp-development-465790699.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/api/health

# Test MLflow endpoint  
curl https://hokusai-dp-development-465790699.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/mlflow
```
