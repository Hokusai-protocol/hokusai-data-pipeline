# Model Registration Test Report - Current Status

**Date**: 2025-08-05 (18:05 UTC)  
**Tester**: Hokusai Data Pipeline Team  
**API Key Used**: hk_live_chnn8EMMos4Lcwj3i3C3JeAkoNoDcOWL (existing key)

## Executive Summary

Testing reveals significant infrastructure degradation compared to previous tests. The registry service is now returning 503 Service Unavailable errors consistently, indicating a critical service failure that has worsened since the last test.

### Overall Status: ❌ DEGRADED
- **Infrastructure Health Score**: 36.4% (4/11 checks passed) - **DEGRADED from 54.5%**
- **Authentication Success Rate**: 10.0% (2/20 tests passed) - Same as before
- **Model Registration Success**: 25.0% (1/4 stages passed) - Same as before
- **Service Availability**: Registry service returning 503 errors - **NEW CRITICAL ISSUE**

## Critical Issues Status

### 1. ❌ Registry Service Down - NEW CRITICAL ISSUE
**Status**: Registry service returning 503 Service Unavailable  
**Impact**: All MLflow operations fail with 503 instead of 404  
**Evidence**:
- registry.hokus.ai endpoints timing out or returning 503
- All MLflow proxy requests get 503 errors
- Service appears to be completely unavailable

### 2. ✅ Auth Service Remains Operational
**Status**: Auth service still returns 200 OK  
**Impact**: Auth service healthy but cannot validate due to registry issues
**Evidence**:
- `/health` endpoint returns 200 OK
- Response time: ~120-135ms (healthy)
- Service running with 1/1 tasks

### 3. ❌ MLflow Service Unreachable - WORSENED
**Previous**: 404 errors (routing issue)  
**Current**: 503 errors (service unavailable)  
**Impact**: Complete service failure, not just routing

## Test Results Comparison

| Metric | Previous Test | Current Test | Change |
|--------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| **Infrastructure Health** | 54.5% (6/11) | 36.4% (4/11) | ❌ -18.1% |
| **Auth Service Status** | 200 OK | 200 OK | — Stable |
| **Registry Service** | 401/404 errors | 503/Timeout | ❌ Degraded |
| **MLflow Endpoints** | 404 errors | 503 errors | ❌ Worsened |
| **Auth Success Rate** | 10.0% | 10.0% | — No change |
| **Model Registration** | 25.0% | 25.0% | — No change |
| **ECS Services Running** | 3/3 | 3/3 | ✅ Stable |

### Degradation Since Last Test
1. **Registry Service Down**: Now returning 503 errors instead of 401/404
2. **Infrastructure Health Decline**: Score dropped from 54.5% to 36.4%
3. **Endpoint Timeouts**: Multiple endpoints now timing out completely
4. **Service Availability**: Registry service appears completely unavailable

### Improvements Since Last Test
- None identified; overall system health has degraded

### Persistent Issues
1. **MLflow Integration**: Still not functional, now worse (503 vs 404)
2. **API Key Validation**: Cannot test properly due to service unavailability
3. **Model Registration**: Blocked by service failures

## Detailed Test Results

### Infrastructure Health Check
```
Total Checks: 11

- X-API-Key auth: Timeout errors
- Invalid key handling: All return 503
- Service integration: Cannot validate
```

### Model Registration Flow
```
Stage 1: ✅ Local model creation
Stage 2: ❌ MLflow experiment creation (503)
Stage 3: ❌ Model run logging (503)
Stage 4: ❌ Model registration (503)

Success Rate: 25.0%
Error Type: 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Registry Service Failure
The registry service (registry.hokus.ai) is experiencing a complete outage:
1. All endpoints timeout or return 503
2. Service appears to be down at the infrastructure level
3. May indicate:
   - Container crash loop
   - Resource exhaustion
   - Network connectivity issues
   - Load balancer misconfiguration

### Comparison with Previous State
- **Previous**: Service was reachable but had routing issues (404)
- **Current**: Service is completely unavailable (503/timeout)
- **Implication**: Infrastructure problem, not just configuration

## Immediate Actions Required

### Priority 1: Restore Registry Service
```bash
# Check ECS task status
aws ecs describe-tasks \
  --cluster hokusai-development \
  --tasks $(aws ecs list-tasks --cluster hokusai-development --service-name hokusai-mlflow-development --query 'taskArns[0]' --output text)

# Check container logs
aws logs tail /ecs/hokusai-mlflow-development --follow

# Check ALB target health
aws elbv2 describe-target-health \
  --target-group-arn <registry-tg-arn>
```

### Priority 2: Investigate Service Health
1. Check CloudWatch metrics for registry service
2. Review recent deployments or changes
3. Verify resource allocation (CPU/Memory)
4. Check network security groups

### Priority 3: Validate Infrastructure State
```bash
# Check all target groups
aws elbv2 describe-target-groups \
  --names hokusai-registry-tg

# Verify listener rules
aws elbv2 describe-rules \
  --listener-arn <registry-listener-arn>
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Response
1. **CRITICAL**: Investigate registry service outage immediately
2. Check ECS task health and logs
3. Verify ALB target group health checks
4. Review CloudWatch alarms and metrics

### Short-term Fixes
1. Restart registry/MLflow service
2. Scale up service if resource constrained
3. Check and fix health check configuration
4. Verify security group rules

### Long-term Solutions
1. Implement proper monitoring and alerting
2. Add automated recovery mechanisms
3. Improve health check coverage
4. Consider multi-AZ deployment for resilience

## Conclusion

The system has **significantly degraded** since the previous test. While the auth service remains operational and ECS services show as running, the registry service is completely unavailable with 503 errors. This represents a critical production issue requiring immediate attention.

**Current State**: System is non-functional for model registration workflows due to registry service failure.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Restore registry service functionality
2. **After Service Recovery**: Re-run complete test suite
3. **Post-Recovery**: Implement monitoring to prevent future outages
4. **Documentation**: Update runbooks for service recovery procedures
