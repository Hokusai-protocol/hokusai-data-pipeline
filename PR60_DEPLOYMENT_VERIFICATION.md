# PR #60 Deployment Verification Report

**Date**: 2025-07-24  
**PR**: #60 - Fix MLflow proxy routing for model registration  
**Status**: ✅ **SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED AND WORKING**

## Executive Summary

PR #60 has been successfully deployed to production (the "development" environment). Model registration through the Hokusai API is now working correctly using the `/api/mlflow/*` endpoints.

## Deployment Details

- **Deployment Time**: 2025-07-24 14:05:05 UTC
- **Environment**: hokusai-development (production)
- **API Endpoint**: https://registry.hokus.ai
- **MLflow Proxy**: https://registry.hokus.ai/api/mlflow

## Test Results

### Working Endpoints ✅

1. **Experiments API**
   - `POST /api/mlflow/api/2.0/mlflow/experiments/create` ✅
   - `GET /api/mlflow/api/2.0/mlflow/experiments/search` ✅

2. **Runs API**
   - `POST /api/mlflow/api/2.0/mlflow/runs/create` ✅
   - `POST /api/mlflow/api/2.0/mlflow/runs/log-metric` ✅

3. **Model Registry API**
   - `POST /api/mlflow/api/2.0/mlflow/registered-models/create` ✅
   - `GET /api/mlflow/api/2.0/mlflow/registered-models/search` ✅

4. **Artifact API**
   - `/api/mlflow/api/2.0/mlflow-artifacts/*` endpoints are accessible

### Known Limitations

1. **Health Check Endpoints**: The `/mlflow/health/mlflow` endpoints return 404 due to ALB routing configuration
2. **Direct MLflow Access**: The `/mlflow/*` prefix doesn't work (returns 404)
3. **API Health**: Main `/health` endpoint returns 503 (unrelated to MLflow proxy)

## Successful Test Results

Using API key: `hk_live_chnn8EMMos4Lcwj3i3C3JeAkoNoDcOWL`

```

## Key Improvements from PR #60

1. **Intelligent Routing**: Internal MLflow requests use standard `/api/2.0/` paths
2. **Security**: Hokusai auth headers are removed before proxying to MLflow
3. **User Context**: Adds X-Hokusai-User-Id headers for tracking
4. **Dual Mount Points**: Supports both `/mlflow/*` and `/api/mlflow/*` (though only the latter works due to ALB config)

## Recommendations

1. **Update Documentation**: Document that third-party integrations should use `https://registry.hokus.ai/api/mlflow` as the MLflow tracking URI
2. **Fix ALB Routing**: Consider updating ALB rules to properly route `/mlflow/*` requests
3. **Health Checks**: Deploy the health check endpoints to a working path

## Conclusion

PR #60 has successfully resolved the model registration issues. Third-party users can now register models through the Hokusai API using standard MLflow clients by:

1. Setting tracking URI to `https://registry.hokus.ai/api/mlflow`
2. Using their Hokusai API key for authentication
3. Following standard MLflow workflows

The deployment is stable and working in production.
