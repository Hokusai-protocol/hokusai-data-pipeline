# Validation Results: Model Registration Fix

## Fix Implementation Summary
- **Issue**: Syntax error in model_registry.py preventing API service from starting
- **Root Cause**: Malformed comment in function parameter (unclosed parenthesis)
- **Fix Applied**: Corrected syntax and rebuilt Docker image for linux/amd64 platform
- **Deployment**: Successfully deployed fix-amd64 image to ECS

## Validation Results

### ✅ Service Startup
- API service now starts successfully without syntax errors
- Container running stable (1/1 running in ECS)
- Uvicorn server listening on port 8001
- No restart loops observed

### ⚠️ Partial Success - Endpoint Accessibility
- MLflow UI: ✅ Accessible at https://registry.hokus.ai/mlflow/
- API Health: ❌ Still returning 504 (health check configuration issue)
- API MLflow Proxy: ❌ Timing out (requires additional configuration)

### Service Status
```
ECS Service: hokusai-api-development
- Desired Count: 1
- Running Count: 1
- Task Definition: hokusai-api-development:112
- Image: 932100697590.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/hokusai-api:fix-amd64
```

### Logs Verification
```
INFO:     Started server process [1]
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
No syntax errors in logs since deployment of fix.

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Health Check Configuration
- ALB health check expects `/health/alb` endpoint
- Target showing as unhealthy due to timeout
- Need to verify endpoint implementation or adjust health check path

### 2. Network/Security Configuration
- Health checks not reaching the container
- Possible security group or network ACL issue
- May need to check ECS task network mode

### 3. Database Connectivity
- Service starts but may have issues connecting to PostgreSQL
- Need to verify database credentials in task definition

## Test Commands Used

```bash
# Service status check
aws ecs describe-services --cluster hokusai-development --services hokusai-api-development

# Target health check
aws elbv2 describe-target-health --target-group-arn <arn>

# Log monitoring
aws logs tail /ecs/hokusai-api-development --follow

# Endpoint testing
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://registry.hokus.ai/health
```

## Next Steps

While the critical syntax error is fixed and the service is running, additional infrastructure configuration is needed:

1. Fix ALB health check configuration or implement `/health/alb` endpoint
2. Verify security groups allow traffic from ALB to ECS tasks
3. Test model registration once endpoints are accessible
4. Monitor for any other runtime errors

## Success Criteria Met

- [x] API service running with 0 restarts in 30 minutes
- [ ] All /api/mlflow/* endpoints return 200/201 status codes (pending)
- [ ] Model registration test succeeds (pending)
- [x] No syntax errors in CloudWatch logs
- [ ] ALB target group shows all targets healthy (in progress)
