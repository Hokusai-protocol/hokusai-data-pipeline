# Bug Investigation Workflow - COMPLETE ✅

## Bug Summary
**Bug ID:** 500 error when calling model
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED AND VALIDATED
**Date Completed:** 2025-10-07 14:31:54 UTC

---

## Quick Overview

### The Problem
Third-party tester reported HTTP 500 errors when calling Model ID 21 prediction endpoint:
```json
{"detail":"HuggingFace token not configured"}
```

### The Root Cause
**Configuration Drift** - The `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` environment variable was configured in Terraform but never deployed to AWS ECS.

### The Solution
1. Applied Terraform to create ECS task definition revision 151 with HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY
2. Deployed new task definition to ECS
3. Fixed secondary Redis security group issue that blocked validation
4. Validated end-to-end: HTTP 200 with successful model predictions

## Evidence of Fix

### Before Fix
```bash
# ECS Task Definition Revision 150
aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition hokusai-api-development:150
# Result: HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY not present ❌
```

### After Fix
```bash
# ECS Task Definition Revision 151
aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition hokusai-api-development:151
# Result: HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY present ✅
```

### Validation Test
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.hokus.ai/api/v1/models/21/predict \
  -H "X-API-Key: hk_live_pIDV2HHxM4S7nNYgYjz16MvsazH7DQtN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"inputs":{"company_size":1000,"industry":"Technology","engagement_score":75,"website_visits":10,"email_opens":5,"content_downloads":3,"demo_requested":true,"budget_confirmed":false,"decision_timeline":"Q2 2025","title":"VP of Sales"}}'
```

**Result:** ✅ HTTP 200 OK
```json
{
  "model_id": "21",
  "predictions": {
    "lead_score": 70,
    "conversion_probability": 0.7,
    "recommendation": "Hot",
    "factors": ["Demo requested", "High engagement"],
    "confidence": 0.7
  },

## Key Learnings

### Configuration Drift Detection
**Problem:** Terraform configuration existed but was never applied to AWS.

**Lesson:** Implement drift detection and automated verification:
- Use Terraform drift detection tools
- Add CI/CD checks to verify configuration matches infrastructure
- Implement alerts for configuration mismatches

### Multi-Issue Resolution
**Discovered:** Redis security group rule also had configuration drift.

**Lesson:** When fixing configuration drift, check for other similar issues:
- Systematically review all security group rules
- Verify all infrastructure matches Terraform state
- Document all drift issues found

### Systematic Investigation
**Success:** Following the 11-step workflow led to quick root cause identification.

**Lesson:** Structured investigation methodology works:
- Generate multiple hypotheses
- Test systematically
- Document everything
- Build knowledge base for future issues
