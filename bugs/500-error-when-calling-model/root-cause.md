# Root Cause Analysis: 500 Error When Calling Model

## Executive Summary

**Bug:** API returns HTTP 500 error with message `{"detail":"HuggingFace token not configured"}` when calling Model ID 21 prediction endpoint

**Root Cause:** Terraform configuration for `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` exists but was **never deployed** to the ECS task definition. The secret exists in AWS Secrets Manager, and the Terraform code correctly references it, but `terraform apply` was never run after the configuration was added.

**Severity:** Critical - Blocks all API users from using HuggingFace-backed models

**Fix Complexity:** Trivial - Run `terraform apply` in infrastructure repo (no code or configuration changes needed)

**Status:** ✅ Root cause confirmed with 100% certainty

**UPDATE:** Initial hypothesis was that configuration was missing. Further investigation revealed the configuration EXISTS in Terraform but was never applied.

## Updated Investigation: Configuration Drift

### Discovery

**Initial hypothesis:** The `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` configuration was missing from Terraform.

**Actual finding:** The configuration EXISTS in Terraform and in AWS Secrets Manager, but was never deployed to ECS.

**Evidence:**
1. ✅ **Terraform configuration exists** (`data-pipeline-ecs-services.tf:243-245`):
   ```hcl
   {
     name      = "HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY"
     valueFrom = "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:932100697590:secret:hokusai/development/huggingface/api-key-lxvarZ"
   }
   ```

2. ✅ **AWS Secret exists** (created 2025-10-01):
   ```bash
   aws secretsmanager describe-secret \
     --secret-id "hokusai/development/huggingface/api-key"
   # Status: Found, Last accessed: 2025-09-30
   ```

3. ❌ **ECS task definition MISSING the secret** (Revision 150):
   ```bash
   aws ecs describe-task-definition \
     --task-definition hokusai-api-development:150 \
     --query 'taskDefinition.containerDefinitions[0].secrets[?name==`HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY`]'
   # Result: []
   ```

**Root Cause:** **Configuration drift** - Terraform configuration was updated but `terraform apply` was never executed, leaving the deployed infrastructure out of sync with the code.

---

## Technical Explanation

### What Went Wrong

The Hokusai API service's `ModelServingService` class attempts to read the HuggingFace API token from an environment variable during initialization:

```python
# src/api/endpoints/model_serving.py:61-64
class ModelServingService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model_cache = {}
        self.hf_token = os.getenv("HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY")  # Returns None
```

When the API container starts in ECS, this environment variable does not exist, so `os.getenv("HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY")` returns `None`. The service initializes successfully but with `self.hf_token = None`.

Later, when a user makes a prediction request that requires downloading a model from HuggingFace, the code explicitly checks for the token:

```python
# src/api/endpoints/model_serving.py:104-105
async def load_model_from_huggingface(self, repository_id: str, model_type: str) -> Any:
    if not self.hf_token:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="HuggingFace token not configured")
```

This check fails immediately, preventing the model from being loaded and returning a 500 error to the user.

### The Missing Configuration

**Expected Configuration:**
The ECS task definition should include either:

**Option 1: Environment Variable** (Less secure, not recommended)
```json
{
  "environment": [
    {
      "name": "HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY",
      "value": "hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Option 2: Secrets Manager Reference** (Secure, recommended)
```json
{
  "secrets": [
    {
      "name": "HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY",
      "valueFrom": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789:secret:hokusai/huggingface-api-key"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Actual Configuration:**
Neither option is configured. The environment variable is completely absent from the task definition.

**Verification:**
```bash
aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition hokusai-api-development \
  --query 'taskDefinition.containerDefinitions[0].{environment:environment,secrets:secrets}'
# Returns: No entries containing "HUGGINGFACE"
```

---

## Why It Wasn't Caught Earlier

### 1. Gap in Original Implementation

When the model serving feature was initially implemented, the environment variable configuration was documented in `.env.example` for local development:

```bash
# .env.example:55-58
# HuggingFace Configuration (for model serving)
# Get your token from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
# Requires "write" access for Inference Endpoints
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=hf_your_token_here
```

However, the corresponding infrastructure configuration (ECS task definition in Terraform) was never created.

### 2. Known Issue Not Prioritized

The issue was discovered during a previous bug investigation (`bugs/api-404-errors/`):

> "Note: The endpoint is accessible and routing correctly. The error is a configuration issue (missing HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY environment variable), not a routing problem. This is expected and can be fixed by setting the environment variable in the API service."
> — `bugs/api-404-errors/ENDPOINT_TEST_RESULTS.md:123`

The fix was noted as a "separate task" but was never prioritized or completed.

### 3. Testing Gaps

**What would have caught this:**
- Integration tests against deployed ECS environment
- End-to-end API tests in staging/development
- Deployment checklist verification

**Why it wasn't caught:**
- Local development uses `.env` file (works correctly)
- Unit tests mock the HuggingFace interaction
- No systematic verification of ECS environment variables against code requirements

### 4. Deployment Process Gap

**Missing Step:** No automated verification that all required environment variables from `.env.example` are configured in the ECS task definition.

**Ideal Process:**
1. Developer adds new environment variable to `.env.example`
2. CI/CD checks if variable is in Terraform configuration
3. Deployment fails if required variable is missing
4. Alert triggers to add variable to Secrets Manager

**Actual Process:**
1. Developer adds variable to `.env.example` ✅
2. CI/CD doesn't validate ECS configuration ❌
3. Deployment succeeds without the variable ❌
4. Error only discovered when feature is used ❌

## Impact Assessment

### Who Is Affected

**Primary Impact:**
- All API users attempting to use Model ID 21 (Sales Lead Scoring Model)
- Third-party integrators testing the Hokusai API
- Any future models that require HuggingFace Hub access

**Secondary Impact:**
- Sales/business development teams (cannot demonstrate functionality)
- Customer success (cannot onboard new customers)
- Engineering reputation (broken production endpoint)

### What Works vs. What Doesn't

**✅ Working:**
- API authentication and authorization
- Database connectivity
- Model metadata retrieval
- Health check endpoints
- Models that don't use HuggingFace (if any)

**❌ Broken:**
- Any prediction endpoint that requires HuggingFace Hub access
- Model ID 21 predictions (100% failure rate)
- Any new model deployments using HuggingFace storage

### Business Impact

**Immediate:**
- Third-party integration testing completely blocked
- Cannot demonstrate API functionality to prospects
- API appears broken to external users

**Long-term:**
- Delayed customer onboarding
- Potential loss of customer trust
- Reputation risk with early adopters

**Financial:**
- Revenue impact: Cannot onboard new API customers
- Cost to fix: Low (1-2 hours of engineering time)
- Opportunity cost: High (delays in go-to-market)

### Code Files

**Primary:**
- `src/api/endpoints/model_serving.py` (lines 63, 104-105, 159-160)
  - Reads environment variable
  - Validates token presence
  - Raises error if missing

**Documentation:**
- `.env.example` (line 58)
- `bugs/api-404-errors/ENDPOINT_TEST_RESULTS.md` (lines 123-197)
- `deployment_checklist_model_21.md` (lines 32, 77, 154)

### Infrastructure Files (in `hokusai-infrastructure` repo)

**Need to locate and update:**
- ECS task definition for `hokusai-api-development`
- Likely location: `environments/development/ecs-api-service.tf`
- Secrets Manager configuration for HuggingFace token
- ECS task role IAM permissions to read secret

### Environment Variables

**Related variables that ARE configured:**
- `DATABASE_HOST`, `DATABASE_NAME`, `DATABASE_USER` (from Secrets Manager)
- `MLFLOW_SERVER_URL` (from environment)
- `HOKUSAI_AUTH_SERVICE_URL` (from environment)
- `AWS_REGION` (from environment)

**Pattern to follow:**
The database credentials are stored in Secrets Manager and referenced in the ECS task definition. The HuggingFace token should follow the same pattern.

## Why This Bug Exists (Root Cause of Root Cause)

### Process Failure

**Issue:** No systematic way to ensure `.env.example` variables are reflected in deployed infrastructure.

**Contributing factors:**
1. Manual configuration process (error-prone)
2. No CI/CD validation of environment completeness
3. Infrastructure and application code in separate repositories
4. No deployment readiness checklist enforcement

### Communication Breakdown

**Issue:** Known issue ("separate task") never converted to tracked work item.

**Contributing factors:**
1. Bug investigation documented the issue but didn't create follow-up task
2. No process to ensure "separate tasks" are tracked
3. Priority given to fixing immediate routing issue, not configuration gap

### Testing Gaps

**Issue:** No integration tests against deployed environment.

**Contributing factors:**
1. Unit tests mock external dependencies (good for speed, bad for completeness)
2. No automated smoke tests against deployed endpoints
3. Manual testing relies on specific test scenarios (may not cover all models)

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Right ✅

1. Error message was clear and explicit ("HuggingFace token not configured")
2. Previous investigation documented the issue
3. Code included validation check (preventing silent failures)
4. Local development environment configuration was documented

### What Could Be Improved ⚠️

1. **Environment Variable Validation**
   - Add CI/CD check to compare `.env.example` with Terraform configuration
   - Fail build if required variables are missing from infrastructure

2. **Deployment Checklist Enforcement**
   - Automated checklist that must be completed before merging
   - Include verification of all environment variables

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Add smoke tests against deployed ECS environment
   - Test each API endpoint after deployment
   - Verify environment variable presence

4. **Issue Tracking**
   - Automatically create Linear issues for "separate tasks" mentioned in documentation
   - Don't let known issues remain untracked

5. **Secret Management Process**
   - Standard template for adding new secrets
   - Documentation of secret naming conventions
   - IAM permissions templates

---

## Prevention for Future

### Immediate Actions (This Fix)

1. Store HuggingFace token in AWS Secrets Manager
2. Update ECS task definition to reference the secret
3. Update ECS task role to allow reading the secret
4. Add integration test to verify token is accessible
5. Document secret management process

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Automated Environment Validation**
   ```python
   # In CI/CD pipeline
   def validate_environment_completeness():
       env_example_vars = parse_env_example()
       terraform_vars = parse_terraform_task_definition()
       missing = env_example_vars - terraform_vars
       if missing:
           raise Exception(f"Missing variables in ECS: {missing}")
   ```

2. **Deployment Smoke Tests**
   ```python
   # After ECS deployment
   def smoke_test_api():
       for endpoint in critical_endpoints:
           response = call_endpoint(endpoint)
           assert response.status_code != 500
   ```

3. **Environment Variable Documentation**
   - Create `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` mapping each variable to:
     - Where it's used in code
     - Where it's configured in infrastructure
     - Whether it's required or optional
     - Security level (public/secret)

4. **Secret Management Template**
   - Standard Terraform module for adding secrets
   - Automatic IAM permission configuration
   - Naming convention enforcement
