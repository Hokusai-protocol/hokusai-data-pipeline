## Summary

This fix resolves the model registration failure by:
1. Providing clear, actionable error messages
2. Detecting common misconfiguration (MLFLOW_TRACKING_TOKEN without HOKUSAI_API_KEY)
3. Guiding users to the correct solution
4. Maintaining 100% backward compatibility

The third-party user who reported this issue will now receive helpful guidance instead of a cryptic error, allowing them to successfully register their LSCOR model.
