# Root Cause Analysis: Endpoints Inaccessible

## Confirmed Root Cause
**API Service Startup Failure Due to Import Error**

The hokusai-api-development ECS service is crashing on startup due to a Python import error, preventing the API from serving requests and causing all API-related endpoints to be inaccessible.

## Technical Explanation

### The Import Chain Failure
1. **Entry Point**: `/app/src/api/main.py` (line 14)
   ```python
   from src.api.routes import dspy, health, models, health_mlflow, mlflow_proxy_improved as mlflow_proxy
   ```

2. **Route Module**: `/app/src/api/routes/__init__.py` (line 3)
   ```python
   from . import dspy, health, models, mlflow_proxy, mlflow_proxy_improved, health_mlflow
   ```

3. **DSPy Route**: `/app/src/api/routes/dspy.py` (line 11)
   ```python
   from src.services.dspy_pipeline_executor import DSPyPipelineExecutor, ExecutionMode
   ```

4. **Services Module**: `/app/src/services/__init__.py` (line 4)
   ```python
   from .model_registry import HokusaiModelRegistry  # This import fails in the container
   ```

### Why The Import Fails
The import fails in the Docker container but the files exist locally, indicating one of:
1. Files not included in Docker image during build
2. Missing Python dependencies
3. Circular import issues
4. Module path issues in the container environment

## Why It Wasn't Caught Earlier

### Missing CI/CD Checks
- No container startup tests in CI pipeline
- No import validation during Docker build
- Health checks only test runtime, not startup

### Development vs Production Mismatch
- Local development works (files and dependencies present)
- Docker image missing components
- No smoke tests after deployment

## Impact Assessment

### Service Availability
- **API Service**: Complete outage (0% availability)
- **MLflow Service**: Partial functionality (registry works, API proxy fails)
- **Auth Service**: Fully functional (100% availability)

### User Impact
- Cannot register models via API
- Cannot access model endpoints
- Cannot use platform features requiring API
- Auth works but has no API to authenticate against

### Business Impact
- Complete platform outage for model operations
- Blocks all ML workflows
- Prevents model deployment and serving

## Related Code Sections

### Dockerfile.api
- Need to verify COPY statements include all source files
- Check if requirements.txt includes all dependencies

### docker-compose.yml
- Verify volume mounts for local development
- Check environment variable configuration

### src/services/__init__.py
- Imports that work locally but fail in container
- May need conditional imports or error handling

## Timeline of Failure

1. **Last Known Good State**: Unknown (no monitoring data)
2. **First Error Detected**: Import errors in CloudWatch logs
3. **Service Restart Loop**: ECS continuously restarting failed tasks
4. **User Reports**: "Endpoints inaccessible" bug filed
5. **Investigation Started**: Current debugging session

## Contributing Factors

1. **Incomplete Docker Build**
   - Missing COPY statements for new files
   - Outdated Docker image cache

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Missing packages in requirements.txt
   - Version conflicts between environments

3. **Lack of Testing**
   - No container startup tests
   - No import validation in CI/CD

4. **Monitoring Gaps**
   - No alerts for service startup failures
   - Health checks don't catch startup errors

## Prevention Measures

### Immediate
1. Add all source files to Dockerfile
2. Update requirements.txt with all dependencies
3. Add startup validation to health checks

### Long-term
1. Implement container startup tests in CI
2. Add import validation during Docker build
3. Create smoke tests for deployments
4. Improve monitoring for startup failures
5. Maintain parity between dev and prod environments
