## Hypothesis 1: Infrastructure Not Deployed
**Status:** REJECTED ‚ùå
**Priority:** HIGH

### Test 1.1: Check if ALBs exist
**Result:** PASSED ‚úÖ
- All ALBs exist and are active:
  - hokusai-development
  - hokusai-mlflow-int-development
  - hokusai-registry-development
  - hokusai-auth-development
  - hokusai-main-development
  - hokusai-dp-development

### Test 1.2: DNS Resolution
**Result:** PASSED ‚úÖ
- registry.hokus.ai ‚Üí hokusai-registry-development ALB
- api.hokus.ai ‚Üí hokusai-main-development ALB
- auth.hokus.ai ‚Üí hokusai-auth-development ALB
- All domains resolve correctly to ALB endpoints

### Conclusion
Infrastructure IS deployed. Moving to next hypothesis.

## Hypothesis 2: ECS Services Not Running
**Status:** PARTIALLY CONFIRMED ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Priority:** HIGH

### Test 2.1: ECS Service Status
**Result:** MIXED
- All services show as ACTIVE with 1/1 running tasks
- However, API service is failing to start properly

### Test 2.2: Target Group Health
**Result:** FAILED ‚ùå
- hokusai-reg-api-development: UNHEALTHY (Target.Timeout)
- hokusai-reg-mlflow-development: 1 healthy, 1 unhealthy
- hokusai-api-tg-development: UNHEALTHY (Target.Timeout)
- hokusai-auth-tg-development: HEALTHY ‚úÖ

### Test 2.3: Service Logs Analysis
**Result:** ROOT CAUSE FOUND! üîç
- API service has a Python import error on startup
- Error occurs in: `/app/src/api/main.py` line 14
- Import chain: main.py ‚Üí routes/__init__.py ‚Üí dspy.py ‚Üí services/__init__.py
- The service is crashing repeatedly due to this import error

### Specific Error Details
```
File "/app/src/services/__init__.py", line 4, in <module>
  from .model_registry import HokusaiModelRegistry
```

The files exist locally but may not be in the Docker image or have dependency issues.

---

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
**The API service cannot start due to an import error in the application code**

### Evidence:
1. Auth service is healthy and responding (200 OK)
2. Registry endpoint times out (API service unhealthy)
3. API endpoint returns 404 (ALB has no healthy targets)
4. MLflow service has mixed health (partial functionality)
5. API service logs show repeated Python import failures

### Next Steps:
1. Check if Docker image has all required files
2. Verify Python dependencies are installed
3. Fix the import issue in the code
4. Rebuild and redeploy the API service
