# Fix Validation: Endpoints Inaccessible

## Fix Applied
**Commit:** c05de40
**Branch:** bugfix/endpoints-inaccessible

### Code Change
Fixed syntax error in `src/services/model_registry.py` line 26:
- Removed inline comment that was breaking Python syntax
- Applied code formatting via pre-commit hooks

## Validation Results

### Local Testing ✅
```bash
# Docker build successful
docker build -f Dockerfile.api -t hokusai-api:fix-v2 --platform linux/amd64 .
# Status: SUCCESS

# Import test
docker run --rm hokusai-api:fix-v2 python -c "from src.api.main import app; print('Import successful!')"
# Result: Import successful (fails only on missing env vars, not syntax)
```

### Deployment Status ⚠️
- Docker image built successfully
- ECR push experiencing network issues (timeout)
- ECS service update attempted but using old image

### Root Cause Confirmed ✅
1. **Before Fix:** Container crashed with `SyntaxError: '(' was never closed`
2. **After Fix:** Container starts normally (only env var warnings)
3. **Error Location:** src/services/model_registry.py:26

## Remaining Issues

### Infrastructure
- ECR push timeouts preventing deployment
- Need to complete push and update ECS service

### Code Quality
- Pre-commit hooks identify ANN101 warnings (self type annotations)
- MLflow authentication warnings (not related to bug)

## Next Steps

### To Complete Fix Deployment
1. Successfully push Docker image to ECR
2. Update ECS task definition with new image
3. Force new deployment of hokusai-api-development service
4. Verify health checks pass

### To Verify Full Resolution
```bash
# Check service health
curl https://api.hokus.ai/health
# Expected: 200 OK

# Check registry endpoint
curl https://registry.hokus.ai/health
# Expected: 200 OK

# Check model endpoints
curl https://api.hokus.ai/api/v1/models
# Expected: 200 OK or 401 (auth required)
```

## Test Checklist

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Python imports work locally
- [x] Docker build completes
- [x] Container starts without syntax errors

### Integration Tests
- [ ] API service registers with ALB
- [ ] Health checks pass
- [ ] Endpoints respond to requests

### Regression Tests
- [ ] MLflow connectivity maintained
- [ ] Auth service integration works
- [ ] Database connections functional

## Summary

The root cause (syntax error in model_registry.py) has been identified and fixed locally. The fix has been validated in a Docker container and committed to the repository. 

However, deployment to AWS is blocked by ECR push issues. Once the Docker image is successfully pushed and the ECS service updated, the endpoints should become accessible again.

**Fix Status:** Code fixed ✅ | Deployment pending ⚠️
