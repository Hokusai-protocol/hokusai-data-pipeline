# Hokusai API Proxy - Bearer Token Authentication Solution

## Executive Summary

The Hokusai API proxy **already supports Bearer token authentication**. No code changes are required. The implementation is complete and correct.

## Current Implementation Analysis

### What's Already Working

1. **Authentication Middleware** (`src/middleware/auth.py`):
   - ✅ Extracts API keys from `Authorization: Bearer <token>` headers
   - ✅ Validates tokens with external auth service
   - ✅ Caches successful validations for performance
   - ✅ Adds user context to requests

2. **MLflow Proxy** (`src/api/routes/mlflow_proxy.py`):
   - ✅ Strips authentication headers before forwarding
   - ✅ Preserves all other headers and request body
   - ✅ Handles streaming responses for large models
   - ✅ Logs usage for audit trail

3. **Infrastructure Routing**:
   - ✅ `/api/*` routes to API service (port 8001)
   - ✅ API service has `/mlflow` route that proxies to MLflow
   - ✅ `registry.hokus.ai/api/mlflow` should work

## The Real Issue

The 403 errors are NOT due to missing Bearer token support. The issues are:

1. **Deployment Status**: The `/api/mlflow` endpoint may not be deployed or accessible
2. **MLflow Client Path Mismatch**: MLflow client uses `/api/2.0/mlflow/` but direct MLflow uses `/ajax-api/2.0/mlflow/`
3. **Service Discovery**: Clients don't know to use `registry.hokus.ai/api/mlflow` instead of `registry.hokus.ai/mlflow`

## Verification Steps

### 1. Test Current Implementation

```bash
# Test with curl
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     https://registry.hokus.ai/api/mlflow/api/2.0/mlflow/experiments/search
```

### 2. Test with MLflow Client

```python
import os
import mlflow

# Configure MLflow to use proxy
os.environ["MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI"] = "https://registry.hokus.ai/api/mlflow"
os.environ["MLFLOW_TRACKING_TOKEN"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# This should work if the proxy is deployed
client = mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient()
experiments = client.search_experiments()
```

## Deployment Checklist

To ensure the Bearer token authentication works:

1. **Verify API Service is Running**:
   ```bash
   # Check if API service is healthy
   curl https://registry.hokus.ai/health
   ```

2. **Verify MLflow Proxy Route**:
   ```bash
   # Check if mlflow proxy endpoint exists
   curl https://registry.hokus.ai/api/mlflow/health/mlflow
   ```

3. **Check Load Balancer Rules**:
   - Ensure `/api/*` routes to API target group
   - Verify API service is registered in target group
   - Check security groups allow traffic

## Client Configuration Guide

### For SDK Users

```python
from hokusai import setup
import os

# The Hokusai API key works as a Bearer token
os.environ["HOKUSAI_API_KEY"] = "hk_live_..."
os.environ["MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI"] = "https://registry.hokus.ai/api/mlflow"
os.environ["MLFLOW_TRACKING_TOKEN"] = os.environ["HOKUSAI_API_KEY"]

setup(api_key=os.environ["HOKUSAI_API_KEY"])
```

### For Direct MLflow Client Users

```python
import mlflow
import os

# Use Hokusai API key as Bearer token
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("https://registry.hokus.ai/api/mlflow")
os.environ["MLFLOW_TRACKING_TOKEN"] = "hk_live_..."

# Now MLflow client will work
client = mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient()
```

## Summary

**No code changes are needed.** The Hokusai API proxy already implements Bearer token authentication correctly. The middleware extracts Bearer tokens, validates them as Hokusai API keys, and forwards requests to MLflow without auth headers.

The solution is to:
1. Ensure the API service is deployed and accessible
2. Document the correct endpoint: `https://registry.hokus.ai/api/mlflow`
3. Update client examples to use the proxy endpoint
4. Add monitoring to verify the proxy is working

## Monitoring

Add these health checks:

```python
# Health check endpoint already exists
@router.get("/health/mlflow")
async def mlflow_health_check():
    """Check if MLflow server is accessible."""
    # Implementation already in mlflow_proxy.py
```
