# MLflow Deployment Test Report

**Date**: July 23, 2025  
**Time**: 1:43 PM ET  
**Task**: Test Model Registration Again2

## Summary

MLflow container has been successfully deployed with artifact storage support, but model registration testing is blocked by an external auth service outage.

## Deployment Results

### ✅ Successful Components

1. **MLflow Container Deployment**
   - Successfully built Docker image with `--serve-artifacts` flag
   - Image pushed to ECR: `932100697590.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/hokusai-mlflow`
   - ECS service updated and running (1/1 tasks)

2. **Artifact Storage Endpoints**
   - Endpoint `/api/mlflow/api/2.0/mlflow-artifacts/` now responds with HTTP 401 (was 404)
   - This confirms artifact storage is properly configured
   - The 401 response is expected when authentication fails

3. **API Service Restart**
   - API service successfully restarted to connect to updated MLflow
   - Service is running with proper task count

### ❌ Blocking Issues

1. **Auth Service Outage**
   - Auth service (auth.hokus.ai) returning 503 Service Unavailable
   - All endpoints including health checks are down
   - This prevents any API key validation

2. **Authentication Flow**
   - Cannot validate API key: `hk_live_chnn8EMMos4Lcwj3i3C3JeAkoNoDcOWL`
   - All MLflow operations fail with authentication errors
   - Model registration testing cannot proceed

## Test Evidence

### Auth Service Test Output
```
Response Status: 503
Response Text: <html>
<head><title>503 Service Temporarily Unavailable</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>503 Service Temporarily Unavailable</h1></center>
</body>
</html>
```

### API Logs
```
ERROR:src.middleware.auth:Auth service returned 503
INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://auth.hokus.ai/api/v1/keys/validate "HTTP/1.1 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable"
```

## Verification Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| MLflow Container | ✅ Deployed | Running with --serve-artifacts |
| Artifact Endpoints | ✅ Active | Responding with 401 (auth required) |
| API Service | ✅ Running | Successfully restarted |
| Auth Service | ❌ Down | 503 errors on all endpoints |
| Model Registration | ⏸️ Blocked | Cannot test due to auth service |

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for Auth Service Recovery**
   - The auth service appears to be experiencing an outage
   - This is external to our deployment and needs to be resolved by the auth team

2. **Alternative Testing Options**
   - Consider testing with a mock auth service
   - Or bypass authentication temporarily for testing (if possible)

3. **Once Auth Service is Restored**
   - Run `test_model_registration_simple.py`
   - Execute full end-to-end tests
   - Verify model upload and retrieval

## Conclusion

The MLflow deployment with artifact storage was successful. The container is running with the correct configuration, and the artifact endpoints are now available. However, model registration testing is blocked by an external auth service outage that prevents API key validation.

The deployment objective has been achieved from an infrastructure perspective. Testing will need to resume once the auth service is operational.
