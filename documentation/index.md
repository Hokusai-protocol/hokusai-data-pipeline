# Hokusai ML Platform Documentation

Welcome to the Hokusai ML Platform documentation. This comprehensive guide will help you understand and use all features of the Hokusai ecosystem for building, improving, and deploying AI models with decentralized data contributions.

## What is Hokusai ML Platform?

The Hokusai ML Platform is a comprehensive MLOps framework that enables:

- **Token-Incentivized Model Improvement**: Contributors earn rewards for data that improves model performance
- **Verifiable Performance Tracking**: DeltaOne detection automatically identifies ≥1 percentage point improvements
- **Production-Ready ML Infrastructure**: Built on MLflow with added blockchain integration
- **Advanced Model Management**: A/B testing, versioning, and automated rollback capabilities
